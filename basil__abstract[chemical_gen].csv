10,29332819,"The genus Ocimum (Labiatae) comprises 30 species found in tropical and subtropical regions of the planet, of which species O. basilicum L. and O. gratissimum are widely used in food and traditional medicine. Phytochemical studies on Ocimum have revealed a number of essential oil chemotypes, for example, eugenol, methyl chavicol, linalool, and methyl cinnamate. Since essential oils are commercially assessed according to their content, the aim of this study was to develop a simple and precise method for their qualitative and quantitative analysis using NMR spectroscopy combined with chemometrics. Seven essential oils from different species of Ocimum, an unknown sample, and a commercial sample were evaluated and the results compared to those from established and precise GC-MS and GC-FID methods.

24,26797599,"Solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME) and conventional hydro-distillation (HD) were used for the extraction of essential oils (EOs) from Egyptian sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) leaves. The two resulting EOs were compared with regards to their chemical composition, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities. The EO analyzed by GC and GC-MS, presented 65 compounds constituting 99.3% and 99.0% of the total oils obtained by SFME and HD, respectively. The main components of both oils were linalool (43.5% SFME; 48.4% HD), followed by methyl chavicol (13.3% SFME; 14.3% HD) and 1,8-cineole (6.8% SFME; 7.3% HD). Their antioxidant activity were studied with the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH(•)) radical scavenging method. The heating conditions effect was evaluated by the determination of the Total Polar Materials (TPM) content. The antimicrobial activity was investigated against five microorganisms: two Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, two Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one yeast, Candida albicans. Both EOs showed high antimicrobial, but weak antioxidant, activities. The results indicated that the SFME method may be a better alternative for the extraction of EO from O. basilicum since it could be considered as providing a richer source of natural antioxidants, as well as strong antimicrobial agents for food preservation.

Apart from a few exceptions, no significant differences in insecticidal action were observed between basil and spearmint oil. Both oils were highly effective against adult moths, given that notable mortality (>80%) was recorded after exposure to low doses such as 2.5 µl/liter. Noteworthy, egg mortality was also recorded, reaching 73-79% for basil and 56-60% for spearmint. Toxicity data indicated that larvae and pupae were the most tolerant stages in all cases. Larval mortality never exceeded 21 and 18%, for basil and spearmint, respectively, irrespective of moth species. Basil and spearmint oils displayed mortalities as high as 38 and 28% in pupae. Lethal doses (LD50 and LD99) values were estimated via probit analysis. Developmental stage proved to be a significant factor, whereas the effect of oil species on insect mortality was insignificant.

In the present work, we identified the volatile compounds of ethanol extracts of Melissa officinalis, Mentha sp., Ocimum basilicum, Plectranthus barbatus, and Rosmarinus officinalis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Also was evaluated antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts against 6 bacteria of clinical interest, and was tested the interaction of these extracts with a commercial antibiotic streptomycin. Phytol was a compound identified in all extracts by GC/MS, being majoritary component in Plectranthus barbatus and Rosmarinus officinalis. The Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to ethanol extracts, and Plectranthus barbatus and Rosmarinus officinalis were the most active extracts.

68,18643974,"alpha-Zingiberene synthase (ZIS), a sesquiterpene synthase gene that was isolated from lemon basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of alpha-zingiberene, and other sesquiterpenes, from farnesyl diphosphate. Transgenic tomato fruits overexpressing ZIS under the control of the fruit ripening-specific tomato polygalacturonase promoter (PG) accumulated high levels of alpha-zingiberene (224-1000 ng g(-1) fresh weight) and other sesquiterpenes, such as alpha-bergamotene, 7-epi-sesquithujene, beta-bisabolene and beta-curcumene, whereas no sesquiterpenes were detected in non-transformed control fruits. The ZIS-transgenic fruits also produced monoterpenes, such as alpha-thujene, alpha-pinene, beta-phellandrene and gamma-terpinene (1-22 ng g(-1) fresh weight), which were either not detected or were found only in minute concentrations in control fruits. Recombinant ZIS overexpressed in Escherichia coli catalyzed the formation of these monoterpenes from geranyl diphosphate. As the ZIS protein apparently lacks a transit peptide, and is localized in the cytosol, the production of monoterpenes in the transgenic tomatoes suggests that a pool of geranyl diphosphate is available in the cytosol. The phenotype of the ZIS-transgenic tomatoes was the same as that for wild-type tomatoes, with regard to plant vigor and shape, but transgenic plants exhibited a small decrease in lycopene content. This study thus showed that the synthesis of both mono- and sesquiterpenes can be enhanced by the ectopic expression of a single transgene in tomato fruit, and it further demonstrated the interconnection between the pools of terpenoid precursors in the plastids and the cytosol.",The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,"['D019883', 'D002338', 'D003001', 'D011756', 'D004224', 'D004926', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D005822', 'D018551', 'D000081222', 'D039821', 'D018649', 'D009822', 'D010840', 'D030821', 'D011106', 'D018749', 'D012717', 'D014170']","['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases', 'Carotenoids', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Diphosphates', 'Diterpenes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Monocyclic Sesquiterpenes', 'Monoterpenes', 'Ocimum basilicum', 'Oils, Volatile', 'Phytosterols', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Polyisoprenyl Phosphates', 'RNA, Plant', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Transformation, Genetic']",Overexpression of the lemon basil alpha-zingiberene synthase gene increases both mono- and sesquiterpene contents in tomato fruit.,"['Q000235', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000201', 'Q000201', None, None, 'Q000201', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000201', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000201', 'Q000378', 'Q000235', 'Q000378', None]","['genetics', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'enzymology', 'enzymology', None, None, 'enzymology', None, 'metabolism', 'enzymology', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'enzymology', 'metabolism', 'genetics', 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18643974,2008,1,0,qualitative only,basil,0.20253164556962025,"['PG', 'diphosphate', 'alpha-bergamotene, 7-epi-sesquithujene, beta-bisabolene', 'beta-phellandrene', 'geranyl diphosphate', 'lycopene', 'monoterpenes', 'alpha-thujene', 'tomatoes', 'alpha-zingiberene', 'alpha-pinene']",1,16

The obtained results indicated that the MIC values of sweet basil and holy basil oils were 2.0% and 3.0% v/v, respectively, whereas hoary basil oil did not show activity against P. acnes at the highest concentration tested (5.0% v/v). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that methyl chavicol (93.0%) was the major compound in sweet basil oil, and eugenol (41.5%), gamma-caryophyllene (23.7%) and methyl eugenol (11.8%) were major compounds in holy basil oil. Hoary basil oil contained high amounts of geraniol (32.0%) and neral (27.2%) and small amounts of methyl chavicol (0.8%). The Oil-in-water (o/w) micro-emulsions of individual basil oils with concentrations corresponding to their MIC values were formulated. The stable o/w micro-emulsion system for basil oil consisted of 55.0% v/v water phase, 10.0% v/v oil phase (2.0 or 3.0% v/v sweet basil or 3.0% v/v holy basil oil plus 7.0% v/v isopropyl myristate), 29.2% v/v polysorbate 80 and 5.8% v/v 1,2-propylene glycol. Hydroxyethylcellulose at a concentration of 0.5% w/v was used as thickening agent. According to the disc diffusion assay, the formulations containing sweet basil oil exhibited higher activity against P. acnes than those containing holy basil oil, and the thickened formulations tended to give a lower activity against P. acnes than the non-thickened formulations. The prepared micro-emulsions were stable after being tested by a heat-cool cycling method for five cycles. These findings indicate the possibility to use Thai sweet and holy basil oil in suitable formulations for acne skin care.",International journal of cosmetic science,[],[],Evaluation of in vitro antimicrobial activity of Thai basil oils and their micro-emulsion formulas against Propionibacterium acnes.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18492147,2010,1,1,Essential oil,basil,0.16853932584269662,"['v/v isopropyl myristate', 'v/v sweet basil', 'methyl chavicol', 'Hoary basil', 'basil oils', 'sweet basil', 'eugenol', 'geraniol', 'gamma-caryophyllene', 'methyl eugenol', 'Ocimum sanctum', 'neral', 'Propionibacterium', 'Ocimum basilicum L.

In view of this Ocimum basilicum seeds which swell upon wetting could serve as natural immobilized source of agriculturally-based polysaccharides. The seeds consist of an inner hard core and a pectinous fibrillar outer layer. Pretreating the seeds with acid, alkali, periodate or boiling in water was found to alter the metal binding capacity. Of the various treatments given, seeds boiled in water were found to be superior in terms of mechanical stability and exhibited fairly optimal Cr(VI) uptake kinetics. The maximum adsorption capacity as calculated from the Langmuir isotherm was 205 mg Cr/g dry seeds. Biosorption of Cr(VI) was found to be pH dependent with maximum uptake at pH 1.5 wherein sorption was not affected by the presence of other metal ions such as Cd(2+), Cu(2+), Ca(2+) and Na(+).

4,30943244,"Food production in conventional agriculture faces numerous challenges such as reducing waste, meeting demand, maintaining flavor, and providing nutrition. Contained environments under artificial climate control, or cyber-agriculture, could in principle be used to meet many of these challenges. Through such environments, phenotypic expression of the plant-mass, edible yield, flavor, and nutrients-can be actuated through a ""climate recipe,"" where light, water, nutrients, temperature, and other climate and ecological variables are optimized to achieve a desired result. This paper describes a method for doing this optimization for the desired result of flavor by combining cyber-agriculture, metabolomic phenotype (chemotype) measurements, and machine learning. In a pilot experiment, (1) environmental conditions, i.e. photoperiod and ultraviolet (UV) light (known to affect production of flavor-active molecules in edible plants) were applied under different regimes to basil plants (Ocimum basilicum) growing inside a hydroponic farm with an open-source design; (2) flavor-active volatile molecules were measured in each plant using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS); and (3) symbolic regression was used to construct a surrogate model of this chemistry from the input environmental variables, and this model was used to discover new combinations of photoperiod and UV light to increase this chemistry. These new combinations, or climate recipes, were then implemented in the hydroponic farm, and several of them resulted in a marked increase in volatiles over control. The process also led to two important insights: it demonstrated a ""dilution effect"", i.e. a negative correlation between weight and desirable chemical species, and it discovered the surprising effect that a 24-hour photoperiod of photosynthetic-active radiation, the equivalent of all-day light, induces the most flavor molecule production in basil. In this manner, surrogate optimization through machine learning can be used to discover effective recipes for cyber-agriculture that would be difficult and time-consuming to find using hand-designed experiments.",PloS one,"['D000383', 'D003491', 'D004780', 'D000069550', 'D055432', 'D018649', 'D010865', 'D018515', 'D012107', 'D055549']","['Agriculture', 'Cybernetics', 'Environment, Controlled', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolomics', 'Ocimum basilicum', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Leaves', 'Research Design', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Flavor-cyber-agriculture: Optimization of plant metabolites in an open-source control environment through surrogate modeling.,"['Q000379', 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378']","['methods', 'methods', None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30943244,2019,0,1,Flavor-active volatile molecules,basil,0.010416666666666666,['nutrients-can'],1,1

It is estimated that more than 80% of human exposure to dioxins and related compounds comes from the consumption of animal-origin food, and farm animals are exposed to dioxins mainly through the feed. A monitoring programme for dioxins (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs)) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) was conducted in the Polish feed market between 2004 and 2017. Using two complementary ISO 17025-accredited analytical methods (bioassay and high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS)), 2919 samples of plant, animal and minerals origin were analysed. The total number of samples exceeding the maximum limit (ML) was 52, which is 1.8% of all tested samples. They all contained PCDD/Fs in concentrations over the ML, and in 16 samples the limit for the sum of PCDD/F/DL-PCBs was also exceeded. The highest dioxins level was found in feedstuffs derived from Baltic fish; the fish oil was followed by fish meal. Low-chlorinated furans (2.3,7,8 TCDF, 2,3,4,7,8-PCDF and 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDF) were dominant and these congeners accounted for the toxicity expressed in WHO toxic equivalents (WHO-TEQ). In this category, 155 out of the 498 samples (32%) exceeded the action threshold (AT) for PCDD/Fs and in 10 samples (2.0%) for DL-PCBs. Non-compliant fish meals were found in 34 (5.6%) of the tested samples, in 0.7% of compound feeds, and in 1.5% of plant-origin materials. Seven dried plant-derived materials contained PCDD/F level above ML, including alfalfa, maize, apple, basil and beet pulp pellets containing molasses.

The essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation and characterized chemically by gas chromatography coupled with both mass spectrometry and flame ionization detector. The working solutions of essential oil emulsified with Tween 20 and dissolved in distilled water were prepared at three concentration levels (0.01%, 0.1% and 1%, vol/vol). The results obtained showed that increase of essential oil concentration leads to decrease of seed germination, shoot and radical length of velvetleaf. The obtained data revealed a highly significant effect (P < 0.05) between control and 1% and 0.1% oil concentrations in all treatments.

Herein, the potential of DWWs produced by the distillation of packaged fresh basil, rosemary and sage wastes was evaluated by chemical and antioxidant characterization. HPLC-DAD-HRMS profiling revealed that DWWs contain water-soluble phenolic compounds, mainly caffeic acid derivatives and flavonoid glycosides, with rosmarinic acid (RA) as predominant components (29-135mg/100mL). DWWs demonstrated high levels of total phenolic compounds (TPC, 152-443mg GAE/100mL) and strong antioxidant capacities, in ORAC, DPPH and ABTS assays (1101-4720, 635-4244 and 571-3145μmol TE/100mL, respectively).

13,28633539,"In Persian nutrition culture, drinking aromatic waters (hydrosols, distillate) has a long history as functional beverages or therapeutic remedies. The co-distilled water with essential oils, which contains partial amounts of more water-soluble volatile compounds are diluted and used as beverages. Since the solubility of volatile components is different in water, the overall composition, and thus the biological activities of aromatic waters seem to be different from the essential oils they were co-distilled with. Despite the essential oils, chemical constituents of many aromatic waters have not been evaluated scientifically. This research investigated hydrosols used for mental and neurological health maintenance in Persian nutrition culture and their chemical constituents. Constitutions of these hydrosols were extracted by liquid/liquid extraction method and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Furthermore, cluster analysis was used to evaluate the relevance of these hydrosols chemical constituents. About 93 compounds were identified from 20 aromatic waters. the major or second major constituents were thymol (azarol howthorn, frankincense, lemon balm, valerian, shadab), phenethyl alcohol (damask rose, dog-rose, starflower), carvacrol (basil, creeping buttercup, lemon balm); eugenol (shadab, dog-rose, starflower, basil), camphor (yarrow and wormwood), carvone (oriental plane), caryophyllene (cuminum), cinnamaldehyde (Chinese cinnamon), p-cymen-7-ol (musk willow), limonene (lemon verbena), linalool and α-terpineol (bitter orange), menthol (date palm) and methyl 5-vinylnicotinate (olive).

19,27061877,"Ocimum (sweet basil) is a plant of considerable commercial importance in traditional medicine worldwide as well as for the flavor and food industry. The goal of this study was to examine Ocimum extracts anti-acetylcholinesterase activity and to correlate the activity with their secondary metabolites profiles via a metabolome based ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) approach coupled to chemometrics. The metabolomic differences in phenolics from leaves derived from 4 Ocimum species: Ocimum basilicum, Ocimum africanum, Ocimum americanum and Ocimum minimum were assessed. Under optimized conditions, 81 metabolites were identified including 21 hydroxy cinnamic acids, 4 benzoic acid conjugates, 14C/O flavonoid conjugates, 2 alcohols, 5 acyl sugars, 4 triterpenes and 12 fatty acids. Several salviolanic acid derivatives including salviolanic acid A, B, C & I found in Salvia, were found in Ocimum herein for the first time. Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and supervised orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were further used for comparing and classification of samples. A clear separation among the four investigated Ocimum species was revealed, with O. africanum samples found most enriched in hydroxy cinnamates conjugates (HC) and flavonoids. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for compositional differences among Ocimum leaves via a metabolomic approach revealing that among examined species O. africanum leaves present a better source of Ocimum bioactive metabolites. The anticholinesrase activity of examined species was further assessed with a potent IC50 values for O. americanum, O. africanum, O. basilicum ranging from 2.5 to 6.6mg/ml, whereas O. minimum was least active with IC50 of 31.4mg/ml. Furthermore, major HC i.e., caftaric, chlorogenic and rosmarinic acids identified in extracts via UPLC-MS analysis exhibited IC50 values of 24, 0.5 and 7.9mg/ml respectively, suggesting that HCs are likely to mediate for the anticholinesterase effect in Ocimum extracts.

In several countries, including Brazil, Clostridium perfringens is among the five main causative agents of food-borne diseases. The present study determines antimicrobial activities of essential oils of six condiments commonly used in Brazil, viz., Ocimum basilicum L. (basil), Rosmarinus officinalis L. (rosemary), Origanum majorana L. (marjoram), Mentha × piperita L. var. Piperita (peppermint), Thymus vulgaris L. (thyme) and Pimpinella anisum L. (anise) against C. perfringens strain A. Chemical compositions of the oils were determined by GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry). The identities of the isolated compounds were established from the respective Kováts indices, and a comparison of mass spectral data was made with those reported earlier. The antibacterial activity was assessed from minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) using the microdilution method. Minimum inhibitory concentration values were 1.25mgmL(-1) for thyme, 5.0mgmL(-1) for basil and marjoram, and 10mgmL(-1) for rosemary, peppermint and anise. All oils showed bactericidal activity at their minimum inhibitory concentration, except anise oil, which was only bacteriostatic.

The method is accurate with the inter-day and intra-day accuracies of quality control samples (QCs) ranging from 95 to 107% and 95 to 108%, respectively. It is also precise with intra-day and inter-day coefficient of variations ranging from 4 to 12% and 5 to 14%, respectively. The lower limit of quantification was 0.1 μg/mL for each antibiotic except flucloxacillin (0.25 μg/mL). Recovery was greater than 96% for all analytes except for ertapenem (78%). Coefficients of variation for the matrix effect were less than 10% over the six batches of plasma. Analytes were stable over three freeze-thaw cycles, and for reasonable hours on the bench top as well as post-preparation. This novel liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method proved accurate, precise and applicable for therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacokinetic studies of the selected β-lactam antibiotics.","Journal of chromatography.

36,24607424,"Since multidrug resistant bacteria are frequently reported from Southeast Asia, our study focused on the occurrence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in fresh imported herbs from Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia. Samples were collected from fresh culinary herbs imported from Southeast Asia in which ESBL-suspected isolates were obtained by selective culturing. Analysis included identification by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, susceptibility testing, XbaI-PFGE, microarray, PCR and sequencing of specific ESBL genes, PCR based replicon typing (PBRT) of plasmids and Southern blot hybridization. In addition, the quinolone resistance genotype was characterized by screening for plasmid mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes and mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of gyrA and parC. The study encompassed fifty samples of ten batches of culinary herbs (5 samples per batch) comprising nine different herb variants. The herbs originated from Thailand (Water morning glory, Acacia and Betel leaf), Vietnam (Parsley, Asian pennywort, Houttuynia leaf and Mint) and Malaysia (Holy basil and Parsley). By selective culturing 21 cefotaxime resistant Enterobacteriaceae were retrieved. Array analysis revealed 18 isolates with ESBL genes and one isolate with solely non-ESBL beta-lactamase genes. Mutations in the ampC promoter region were determined in two isolates with PCR and sequencing. The isolates were identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=9), Escherichia coli (n=6), Enterobacter cloacae complex (n=5) and Enterobacter spp. (n=1). All isolates tested were multidrug resistant. Variants of CTX-M enzymes were predominantly found followed by SHV enzymes. PMQR genes (including aac(6')-1b-cr, qnrB and qnrS) were also frequently detected. In almost all cases ESBL and quinolone resistance genes were located on the same plasmid. Imported fresh culinary herbs from Southeast Asia are a potential source for contamination of food with multidrug resistant bacteria. Because these herbs are consumed without appropriate heating, transfer to human bacteria cannot be excluded.

Volatile compounds were collected by headspace absorption, and the components were identified and quantified by using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The responses of antennae of female E. obliqua to the compounds were evaluated with gas chromatography/electroantennography detection. Qualitative and quantitative differences were found among the four odor profiles. Consistent electroantennographic activity was obtained for eight of the volatiles from the four plants: β-myrcene, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, linalool, cis-verbenol, camphor, α-terpineol, and verbenone. In a Y-tube bioassay, six chemicals, β-myrcene, γ-terpinene, (R)-(-)-linalool, (S)-(-)-cis-verbenol, (R)-(+)-camphor, and (S)-(-)-verbenone, were the main compounds responsible for repelling E. obliqua. An eight-component mixture including all of the bioactive compounds (in a ratio of 13:2:13:8:1:24:6:17) from R. officinalis was significantly more effective at repelling the moths than any single compound or a mixture of equal amounts of the eight compounds. Field results demonstrated that intercropping tea plants with R. officinalis effectively suppressed E. obliqua infestations in a tea plantation. Our findings suggests that odor blends of R. officinalis play a role in disturbing host orientation behavior, and in repelling E. obliqua adults, and that R. officinalis should be considered when developing ""push-pull"" strategies aimed at optimizing the control of E. obliqua with semiochemicals.

We show that crude protein extracts from peltate trichomes of sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) cultivars readily hydroxylate position 6 of 7-O-methylated apigenin but not apigenin itself. The responsible protein was identified as a P450 monooxygenase from the CYP82 family, a family not previously reported to be involved in flavonoid metabolism. This enzyme prefers flavones but also accepts flavanones in vitro and requires a 5-hydroxyl in addition to a 7-methoxyl residue on the substrate. A peppermint (Mentha × piperita L.) homolog displayed identical substrate requirements, suggesting that early 7-O-methylation of flavones might be common in the Lamiaceae.

51,22223305,"Basil (Ocimum basilicum) is an important flavourant plant which constitutes the major ingredient of the pasta sauce 'Pesto alla Genovese'. The characteristic smell of basil stems mainly from a handful of terpenoids (methyl cinnamate, eucalyptol, linalool and estragole), the concentration of which varies according to basil cultivars. The simple and rapid analysis of the terpenoid constituents of basil would be useful as a means to optimise harvesting times and to act as a quality control process for basil-containing foodstuffs. Classical analytical techniques such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) are, however, slow, technically demanding and therefore less suitable for routine analysis. A new chemical ionisation technique which allows real-time quantification of traces gases, Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometry (SIFT-MS), was therefore utilised to determine its usefulness for the assay of terpenoid concentrations in basil and pesto sauce headspace. Trace gas analysis was performed using the NO(+) precursor ion which minimised interference from other compounds. Character-impacting compound concentration was measured in basil headspace with good reproducibility and statistically significant differences were observed between cultivars. Quantification of linalool in pesto sauce headspace proved more difficult due to the presence of interfering compounds. This was resolved by careful selection of reaction product ions which allowed us to detect differences between various commercial brands of pesto. We conclude that SIFT-MS may be a valid tool for the fast and reproducible analysis of flavourant terpenoids in basil and basil-derived foodstuffs.",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"['D005504', 'D005740', 'D013058', 'D018649', 'D010936', 'D018515', 'D015203', 'D013729']","['Food Analysis', 'Gases', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Ocimum basilicum', 'Plant Extracts', 'Plant Leaves', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Terpenes']",Quantification of character-impacting compounds in Ocimum basilicum and 'Pesto alla Genovese' with selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22223305,2012,0,1,Terpenes,basil,0.0945945945945946,"['methyl cinnamate', 'estragole', 'eucalyptol', 'linalool', 'terpenoids']",1,7

Optimal e-nose parameters, such as layer heights (1-6 KHz), sensitivity <20 ppm of analytes, selectivity at 50 ppm of terpenes, repeatability and reproducibility were thoroughly adjusted prior to online monitoring. Linearity in reversible responses over a wide concentration range <20-250 ppm has been achieved. Discrimination between molecules of similar molar masses, even for isomers, e.g. α-pinene and β-pinene is possible. The array has proven its sensitive and selective properties of sensor responses (20-1,200 Hz) for the difference of fresh and dried herbs. The sensor data attained was validated by GC-MS, to analyze the profiles of sensor emanation patterns. The shelf-life of herbs was monitored via emanation of organic volatiles during a few days.

61,20000573,"Iprodione is an agricultural fungicide that is difficult to detect in foods by HPLC because it coelutes with natural compounds in the food. We previously showed that food matrix could be degraded with titanium dioxide powder (TP). Here we describe an improved method for detection of iprodione using silica gel supported titanium dioxide (SGT). To synthesize SGT, titania-sol was mixed with diethanolamine, 2-propanol, and titanium tetraisopropoxide. After titania-sol was infiltrated into the silica gel (particle diameter 4 mm), the mixture was dried and then heated. Crude basil extract containing iprodione was mixed with SGT in a quartz vial, and the vial was irradiated with a UV light to selectively decompose the matrix interfering with the iprodione determination. In HPLC chromatograms of the treated solution, the interference peak decreased 35 times faster with SGT than with TP. When SGT (11 g) was added to the extract (20 mL) of dry basil (2 g), black light irradiation for 30 min was enough to quantify iprodione. The recovery rate of iprodione was 99.1%.

In this work, we submitted 54 chromatograms to PCA to automatically compare the metabolite profiles of three different species of plants, namely basil (Ocimum basilicum), peppermint (Mentha piperita), and sweet herb stevia (Stevia rebaudiana), where there were 18 chromatograms for each type of plant. The 54 scores of the m/z 73 data set clustered in three groups according to the three types of plants. Principal component 1 (PC 1) separated the stevia cluster from the basil and peppermint clusters, capturing 61.84% of the total variance. Principal component 2 (PC 2) separated the basil cluster from the peppermint cluster, capturing 16.78% of the total variance.

71,18248593,"The glandular trichome is an excellent model system for investigating plant metabolic processes and their regulation within a single cell type. We utilized a proteomics-based approach with isolated trichomes of four different sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) lines possessing very different metabolite profiles to clarify the regulation of metabolism in this single cell type. Significant differences in the distribution and accumulation of the 881 highly abundant and non-redundant protein entries demonstrated that although the proteomes of the glandular trichomes of the four basil lines shared many similarities they were also each quite distinct. Correspondence between proteomic, expressed sequence tag, and metabolic profiling data demonstrated that differential gene expression at major metabolic branch points appears to be responsible for controlling the overall production of phenylpropanoid versus terpenoid constituents in the glandular trichomes of the different basil lines. In contrast, post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation of some enzymes appears to contribute significantly to the chemical diversity observed within compound classes for the different basil lines. Differential phosphorylation of enzymes in the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP)/terpenoid and shikimate/phenylpropanoid pathways appears to play an important role in regulating metabolism in this single cell type.

When water temperature was increased, the degradation of terpenes became more serious. Prolonged exposure time to each heating temperature also caused decreased terpene stability. The terpene recoveries were determined by conducting subcritical water extraction of sand spiked with terpenes. The recoveries are typically around 70 to 80% for extractions at 100 degrees C. Terpene recoveries were decreased with increasing water temperature due to poorer stability of terpenes.

The EOs were tested against an array of four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes), four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella choleraesuis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (a yeast, Candida albicans, and two molds, Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus). The rationale for this work was to test the possibility of creating a protective atmosphere by using natural compounds that could extend the shelf life of packaged foodstuffs while minimizing organoleptic alterations. In the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. The fungi were the most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the Gram-positive bacterial strains. The Gram-negative strain P. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. The composition of the atmosphere generated by the EOs, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. Cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. As a general rule, MIC (fungi) < MIC (bacteria) with no clear differences between Gram-positive or -negative strains except for P. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the EOs in the vapor phase.

78,15975566,"The structures of xyloglucans from several plants in the subclass Asteridae were examined to determine how their structures vary in different taxonomic orders. Xyloglucans, solubilized from plant cell walls by a sequential (enzymatic and chemical) extraction procedure, were isolated, and their structures were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. All campanulids examined, including Lactuca sativa (lettuce, order Asterales), Tenacetum ptarmiciflorum (dusty miller, order Asterales), and Daucus carota (carrot, order Apiales), produce typical xyloglucans that have an XXXG-type branching pattern and contain alpha-d-Xylp-, beta-D-Galp-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Xylp-, and alpha-L-Fucp-(1-->2)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Xylp- side chains. However, the lamiids produce atypical xyloglucans. For example, previous analyses showed that Capsicum annum (pepper) and Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato), two species in the order Solanales, and Olea europaea (olive, order Lamiales) produce xyloglucans that contain arabinosyl and galactosyl residues, but lack fucosyl residues. The XXGG-type xyloglucans produced by Solanaceous species are less branched than the XXXG-type xyloglucan produced by Olea europaea. This study shows that Ipomoea pupurea (morning glory, order Solanales), Ocimum basilicum (basil, order Lamiales), and Plantago major (plantain, order Lamiales) all produce xyloglucans that lack fucosyl residues and have an unusual XXGGG-type branching pattern in which the basic repeating core contains five glucose subunits in the backbone. Furthermore, Neruim oleander (order Gentianales) produces an XXXG-type xyloglucan that contains arabinosyl, galactosyl, and fucosyl residues. The appearance of this intermediate xyloglucan structure in oleander has implications regarding the evolutionary development of xyloglucan structure and its role in primary plant cell walls.",Carbohydrate research,"['D000438', 'D019659', 'D002212', 'D002236', 'D002473', 'D002851', 'D018552', 'D005936', 'D007477', 'D018545', 'D018551', 'D009682', 'D013058', 'D009844', 'D010802', 'D013045', 'D019032', 'D014990']","['Alcohols', 'Asteraceae', 'Capsicum', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Cell Wall', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Daucus carota', 'Glucans', 'Ions', 'Lettuce', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Phylogeny', 'Species Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Xylans']",Structural analysis of xyloglucans in the primary cell walls of plants in the subclass Asteridae.,"['Q000737', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15975566,2005,0,1,Xyloglucans,basil,0.09195402298850575,"['Asteridae', 'Ocimum basilicum (basil, order Lamiales', 'xyloglucan structure', 'xyloglucan', 'glucose', 'arabinosyl', 'Asterales']",1,8

The petroselinic acid derivatives eluted first, followed sequentially by the oleic and cis-vaccenic acid derivatives, with the sn-2 positional isomer eluting before the sn-1 (3) isomer in each case. Separation of the peaks was almost baseline between petroselinic and oleic acids as well as between oleic and cis-vaccenic acids.

90,9703700,"A surway is presented on the authors' work in the field of volatile oil research. The gas chromatographic method previously used for analysis of essential oils was transformed to capillary gas chromatographic conditions. The method is also suitable for separation of compound-pairs frequently occurring in essential oils (peppermint, rosemary, lavender, sage, clary sage, thyme oils). Beside the gas chromatographic analysis of essential oils, which was necessary for their standardization and qualification, the influence of different extraction methods and some biological facts e.g. the ontogenesis on the change of essential oil composition are also discussed. It has been established that the water steam distillation from acidic medium can be more advantageous than the traditional one, if the volatile terpene derivatives were bound in form of glycosides or dimeric quajazolide lactons were present in plant (oregano, Sideritis, wormwood oils). Comparing the composition of essential oil obtained by water steam distillation and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) it was found that the SFE fractions are richer in ester constituents because the possibility of hydrolysis is reduced, and the oils are more valuable than the classic oils. On the other hand, when the transformation processes are important (chamomile), the distillation is the better method. The change of essential oil composition of Ocimum basilicum L. and Anthriscus cerefolium L. was also studied during the vegetation period. It has been established that in budding and early flowering stages the basil oil was rich in monoterpenes; the quantity of sesquiterpenes and phenylpropane derivatives increased only in later stadiums. Finally the extraction and analytical processes are discussed which are used for standardization of complex plant preparations which contained essential oil as active agent and represented various medicinal forms.",Acta pharmaceutica Hungarica,"['D020843', 'D002849', 'D005419', 'D019684', 'D009822', 'D010936', 'D010946']","['Chamomile', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Flavonoids', 'Magnoliopsida', 'Oils, Volatile', 'Plant Extracts', 'Plants, Medicinal']","[Phytochemical evaluation of essential oils, medicinal plants and their preparations].","[None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","[None, 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9703700,1998,0,1,Essential oil,basil,0.14772727272727273,"['oregano', 'phenylpropane', 'rosemary', 'volatile terpene', 'peppermint', 'quajazolide', 'ester', 'glycosides', 'SFE', 'monoterpenes', 'compound-pairs', 'Ocimum basilicum L. and Anthriscus cerefolium']",1,13

92,6314793,"A review of current information on the composition, pharmacological actions and mode of death from cow's urine concoction (CUC) toxicity is presented. The concoction is prepared from leaves of tobacco, garlic and basil; lemon juice, rock salt and bulbs of onion. The latter items are soaked in the urine from cows which acts as the vehicle in which the active principles in these constituents dissolve. Over fifty chemical compounds have been identified in CUC. The major compounds it contains are benzoic acid, phenylacetic acid, p-cresol, thymol and nicotine. The chemical composition and pharmacological cations of the individual components of CUC are also reviewed. Observations of CUC poisoning in man and experimental animals showed that the main effects of CUC are severe depression of respiration, cardiovascular system, the central nervous system and hypoglycaemia. These toxic effects acting singly or in combination are believed to be the cause(s) of death from CUC. Management is geared towards correcting these adverse effects.",African journal of medicine and medical sciences,"['D000818', 'D000927', 'D001565', 'D019817', 'D002319', 'D002417', 'D002490', 'D002648', 'D003408', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D009538', 'D009549', 'D010101', 'D010648', 'D010936', 'D012119', 'D013943']","['Animals', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Benzoates', 'Benzoic Acid', 'Cardiovascular System', 'Cattle', 'Central Nervous System', 'Child', 'Cresols', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Nicotine', 'Nigeria', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Phenylacetates', 'Plant Extracts', 'Respiration', 'Thymol']","Cow's urine concoction: its chemical composition, pharmacological actions and mode of lethality.","[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000187', None, 'Q000187', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000187', 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'drug effects', None, 'drug effects', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'drug effects', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'drug effects', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6314793,1983,0,0,cow's urine concoction,basil,0.08928571428571429,"['p-cresol', 'phenylacetic acid', 'thymol', 'benzoic acid', 'nicotine']",1,5
