11425797.0,"Specific human milk oligosaccharides, especially fucosylated neutral oligosaccharides, protect infants against specific microbial pathogens. To study the concentrations of individual neutral oligosaccharides during lactation, a total of 84 milk samples were obtained from 12 women at 7 time periods during weeks 1-49 postpartum. The neutral oligosaccharides from each sample were isolated, perbenzoylated, resolved, and quantified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The resultant oligosaccharide peaks, identified by co-elution with authentic standards and mass spectrometry, ranged in size from tri- to octasaccharides. The total concentration of oligosaccharides declined over the course of lactation; the mean concentration at 1 year was less than half that in the first few weeks postpartum. One of the 12 donors produced milk fucosyloligosaccharides that were essentially devoid of alpha1,2 linkages (but contained alpha1,3- and alpha1,4-linked fucose) until late in lactation, consistent with the nonsecretor phenotype. In milk samples from the remaining 11 donors, fucosyloligosaccharides containing alpha1,2-linked fucose were prevalent, and their profiles were distinct from those of fucosyloligosaccharides devoid of alpha1,2-linked fucose. The ratio of alpha1,2-linked oligosaccharide concentrations to oligosaccharides devoid of alpha1,2-linked fucose changed during the first year of lactation from 5:1 to 1:1. Furthermore, the absolute and the relative concentrations of individual oligosaccharides varied substantially, both between individual donors and over the course of lactation for each individual. The patterns of milk oligosaccharides among individuals suggest the existence of many genotype subpopulations. This variation in individual oligosaccharide concentrations suggests that the protective activities of human milk could also vary among individuals and during lactation.",Glycobiology,"['D002236', 'D002240', 'D002851', 'D005260', 'D005643', 'D014644', 'D006801', 'D007223', 'D007231', 'D007774', 'D008895', 'D008969', 'D009844', 'D011247', 'D013997']","['Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Fucose', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lactation', 'Milk, Human', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Pregnancy', 'Time Factors']",Fucosylated human milk oligosaccharides vary between individuals and over the course of lactation.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None]","[None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'genetics', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11425797,2001,1.0,Chaturvedi_01,['HPLC']

16537962.0,"A number of major scientific advances have been realized in the last 25 yr in determining the opportunities and limitations of altering milk composition through nutritional manipulation. Because of the greater sensitivity of milk fat to dietary manipulation than either protein or lactose, nutritional control of milk fat content and fatty acid composition received a great deal of attention. New information emerged linking ruminal production of trans fatty acid isomers with milk fat depression. As a result, research on fatty acid biohydrogenation intensified yielding new insight on the origin of specific trans fatty acid isomers originating from ruminal biohydrogenation and how these isomers were modified by the action of mammary enzymes. The discovery of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) as a potent anticarcinogen also led to extensive work on enhancing its concentration in milk through nutritional manipulation and discovering the physiological effects of specific CLA isomers. New protected fats were developed in recent years that were designed to resist biohydrogenation and enhance the concentration of unsaturated fatty acids in milk. The nutritional factors receiving the most attention during the last 25 yr for their influence on milk protein content were forage-to-concentrate ratio, the amount and source of dietary protein, and the amount and source of dietary fat. New insights were tested on modes of action whereby fat supplements caused a decline in protein concentration. Changes in milk lactose concentration occur only in extreme and unusual feeding situations, but the basic biology of lactose synthesis and regulation are still being explored using modern molecular techniques.

14599042.0,"The neonatal intestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem composed of numerous genera, species and strains of bacteria. This enormous cell mass performs a variety of unique activities that affect both the colonic and systemic physiology. Its primary activities include nutritive, metabolic, immunological and protective functions. Most studies of infants have been based on faecal samples using the classical plating techniques with culturing on specific media. The limitations of these methods must be taken into account when evaluating the varying results of the different studies. The establishment of the gut microbial population is not strictly a succession in the ecological sense; it is rather a complex process influenced by microbial and host interactions and by external and internal factors. The climax intestinal flora is attained in successive stages. The foetal intestine is sterile and bathed in swallowed amniotic fluid. Following delivery, multiple different antigens challenge the intestine of the newborn. The maternal intestinal flora is a source of bacteria for the neonatal gut. The bacterial flora is usually heterogeneous during the first few days of life, independently of feeding habits. After the first week of life, a stable bacterial flora is usually established. In full-term infants a diet of breast milk induces the development of a flora rich in Bifidobacterium spp. Other obligate anaerobes, such as Clostridium spp. and Bacteroides spp., are more rarely isolated and also enterobacteria and enterococci are relatively few. During the corresponding period, formula-fed babies are often colonized by other anaerobes in addition to bifidobacteria and by facultatively anaerobic bacteria; the development of a ""bifidus flora"" is unusual. In other studies the presence of a consistent number of bifidobacteria in infants delivered in large urban hospitals has not been demonstrated, whether the babies were bottle fed or exclusively breastfed. The predominant faecal bacteria were coliforms and bacteroides. According to these studies, environmental factors may be more important than breastfeeding in gut colonization after delivery. Environmental factors are indeed extremely important for the intestinal colonization of infants born by caesarean section. In these infants, the establishment of a stable flora characterized by a low incidence of Bacteroides spp. and by the isolation of few other bacteria is consistently delayed. In extremely low-birthweight infants, hospitalization in neonatal intensive care units, characterized by prolonged antibiotic therapy, parenteral nutrition, delayed oral feedings and intubation seems to affect the composition of the intestinal microbiota. The gut is colonized by a small number of bacterial species; Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria spp. are seldom, if ever, identified.

19841193.0,"The 6 main milk proteins in cattle are encoded by highly polymorphic genes characterized by several nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations, with up to 47 protein variants identified. Such an extensive variation was used for linkage analysis with the description of the casein cluster more than 30 yr ago and has been applied to animal breeding for several years. Casein haplotype effects on productive traits have been investigated considering information on the whole casein complex. Moreover, mutations within the noncoding sequences have been shown to affect the specific protein expression and, as a consequence, milk composition and cheesemaking. Milk protein variants are also a useful tool for breed characterization, diversity, and phylogenetic studies. In addition, they are involved in various aspects of human nutrition. First, the occurrence of alleles associated with a reduced content of different caseins might be exploited for the production of milk with particular nutritional qualities; that is, hypoallergenic milk. On the other hand, the frequency of these alleles can be decreased by selection of sires using simple DNA tests, thereby increasing the casein content in milk used for cheesemaking. Furthermore, the biological activity of peptides released from milk protein digestion can be affected by amino acid exchanges or deletions resulting from gene mutations.

If mother's milk is not available, the second choice is donated and fortified human milk (HM) from the Human Milk Bank (HMB). This study hypothesized that HM could be lyophilized and used as an additive to increase the levels of macronutrients and micronutrients available to VLBW infants. This study aimed to constitute a lyophilized HM concentrate and determine the osmolality and the concentration of macronutrients and micronutrients in HM samples at ""baseline"" and in ""HM concentrates"", analyzed immediately (HMCI), and after 3 (HMC3m) and 6 (HMC6m) months of freezing. Osmolality was verified using the freezing point osmometric method. Macronutrient quantification was performed using the MIRIS Human Milk Analyzer. Micronutrients were determined by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry and by the automated colorimetric method. Bayesian linear mixed effect models were adjusted using OpenBUGS to estimate mean differences and 95% credibility intervals (CrI) of osmolality and of macro- and micronutrients between the types of HM samples. A comparison of dosage values showed a significant increase between HM baseline and HMCI, HMC3m, and HMC6m.

These methods include specialized maltinutrient powdered mixtures (fortifiers), complete liquid formulas designed to be mixed with human milk, complete powdered formulas to be mixed with human milk, and alternate feeding of human milk and preterm formula. Although the optimum nutrition of premature infants is unknown, data are accumulating to suggest that human milk, fortified with additional nutrients, is appropriate for tube-fed infants. The use of fortified human milk typically provides premature infants adequate growth, nutrient retention, and biochemical indices of nutritional status when fed at approximately 180 mL/kg/d compared with unfortified human milk. Data are needed to determine the precise quantity of nutrients to be added as supplements. Nutrient interactions have not been explored in detail. Although large quantities of calcium seem to be needed, the exogenous calcium may affect fat absorption adversely. Manipulation of milk may affect the intrinsic host-defense properties of the milk. Compared with preterm formula, the feeding of fortified human milk may provide significant protection from infection and NEC. Lastly, the potential stimulation of an enteromammary pathway through skin-to-skin contact provides species-specific antimicrobial protection for premature infants.

Recent advances in mass spectrometry-based tools have provided a view of the oligosaccharide structures produced in milk across stages of lactation and among human mothers. One postulated function for these oligosaccharides is to enrich a specific ""healthy"" microbiota containing bifidobacteria, a genus commonly observed in the feces of breast-fed infants. Isolated culture studies indeed show selective growth of infant-borne bifidobacteria on milk oligosaccharides or core components therein. Parallel glycoprofiling documented that numerous Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis strains preferentially consume small mass oligosaccharides that are abundant early in the lactation cycle. Genome sequencing of numerous B. longum subsp. infantis strains shows a bias toward genes required to use mammalian-derived carbohydrates by comparison with adult-borne bifidobacteria.

17311985.0,"Feeding infants breast milk of healthy mothers is associated with a lower incidence of infectious and allergic diseases. Although this effect is of multifactorial origin, it is widely accepted that the entire intestinal flora of breast-fed infants provides antiinfective properties and is an important stimulating factor for the postnatal development of the immune system. The effect of human milk on the postnatal development of the intestinal flora cannot be attributed to a single ingredient. It is generally accepted, however, that human milk oligosaccharides play a key role in this matter. Apart from their prebiotic effects, there is also evidence that human milk oligosaccharides act as receptor analogs to inhibit the adhesion of pathogens on the epithelial surface and interact directly with immune cells. Because of their complexity, oligosaccharides with structures identical to human milk oligosaccharides are not yet available as dietary ingredients. In the current search for alternatives, non-milk-derived oligosaccharides have gained much attention. As 1 example, a mixture of neutral galacto-oligosaccharides and long chain fructo-oligosaccharides have been identified as effective prebiotic ingredients during infancy. Furthermore, another class of oligosaccharides with a potential physiological benefit could be those found in animal milks. Most of the oligosaccharides detected in domestic animal milks have some structural features in common with human milk oligosaccharides. One important fact is the occurrence of sialic acids such as N-acetylneuraminic acids. However, total amounts and individual structures are still different from those in human milk oligosaccharides.

The objectives of this study were to investigate these unique colloidal assemblies and their interfacial properties, i.e. composition and structure of their biological membrane. In mature breast milk, MFG have a mean diameter of 4-5 microm, a surface area of about 2m(2)/g fat and an apparent zeta potential ζ=-6.7 ± 0.5 mV at 37°C. Human MFG contain 3-4mg polar lipids/g fat as quantified by HPLC/ELSD.

8154907.0,"Whether breast milk influences later neurodevelopment has been explored in non-randomised studies, potentially confounded by social and demographic differences between feed groups. Here in a strictly randomised prospective multicentre trial, Bayley psychomotor and mental development indices (PDI and MDI) were assessed at 18 months postterm in survivors of 502 preterm infants assigned to receive, during their early weeks, mature donor breast milk or a preterm formula. These diets were compared as sole enteral feeds or as supplements to the mother's expressed breast milk. No differences in outcome at 18 months were seen between the two diet groups despite the low nutrient content of donor milk in relation to the preterm formula and to the estimated needs of preterm infants. These results contrast with those reported from our parallel two centre study that compared infants randomly assigned a standard term formula or the preterm formula during their early weeks; those fed standard formula, now regarded as nutritionally insufficient for preterm infants, were substantially disadvantaged in PDI and MDI at 18 months post-term. It is shown here that infants from that study fed solely on standard formula had significantly lower developmental scores at 18 months than those fed on donor breast milk in the present study; yet the standard formula had a higher nutrient content than the donor milk. Thus, donor milk feeding was associated with advantages for later development that may have offset any potentially deleterious effects of its low nutrient content for preterm infants.

22514647.0,"The role of neo-angiogenesis in prostate cancer (PCA) growth and metastasis is well established, but the development of effective and non-toxic pharmacological inhibitors of angiogenesis remains an unaccomplished goal. In this regard, targeting aberrant angiogenesis through non-toxic phytochemicals could be an attractive angiopreventive strategy against PCA. The rationale of the present study was to compare the anti-angiogenic potential of four pure diastereoisomeric flavonolignans, namely silybin A, silybin B, isosilybin A and isosilybin B, which we established previously as biologically active constituents in Milk Thistle extract. Results showed that oral feeding of these flavonolignans (50 and 100 mg/kg body weight) effectively inhibit the growth of advanced human PCA DU145 xenografts. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that these flavonolignans inhibit tumor angiogenesis biomarkers (CD31 and nestin) and signaling molecules regulating angiogenesis (VEGF, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, phospho-Akt and HIF-1α) without adversely affecting the vessel-count in normal tissues (liver, lung, and kidney) of tumor bearing mice. These flavonolignans also inhibited the microvessel sprouting from mouse dorsal aortas ex vivo, and the VEGF-induced cell proliferation, capillary-like tube formation and invasiveness of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro.

16537962.0,"A number of major scientific advances have been realized in the last 25 yr in determining the opportunities and limitations of altering milk composition through nutritional manipulation. Because of the greater sensitivity of milk fat to dietary manipulation than either protein or lactose, nutritional control of milk fat content and fatty acid composition received a great deal of attention. New information emerged linking ruminal production of trans fatty acid isomers with milk fat depression. As a result, research on fatty acid biohydrogenation intensified yielding new insight on the origin of specific trans fatty acid isomers originating from ruminal biohydrogenation and how these isomers were modified by the action of mammary enzymes. The discovery of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) as a potent anticarcinogen also led to extensive work on enhancing its concentration in milk through nutritional manipulation and discovering the physiological effects of specific CLA isomers. New protected fats were developed in recent years that were designed to resist biohydrogenation and enhance the concentration of unsaturated fatty acids in milk. The nutritional factors receiving the most attention during the last 25 yr for their influence on milk protein content were forage-to-concentrate ratio, the amount and source of dietary protein, and the amount and source of dietary fat. New insights were tested on modes of action whereby fat supplements caused a decline in protein concentration. Changes in milk lactose concentration occur only in extreme and unusual feeding situations, but the basic biology of lactose synthesis and regulation are still being explored using modern molecular techniques.

These bacteria could protect the infant against infections and contribute to the maturation of the immune system, among other functions. Different studies suggest that some bacteria present in the maternal gut could reach the mammary gland during late pregnancy and lactation through a mechanism involving gut monocytes. Thus, modulation of maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy and lactation could have a direct effect on infant health. On the other hand, mammary dysbiosis may lead to mastitis, a condition that represents the first medical cause for undesired weaning.

20372777.0,"Changes in life style over the past several decades including much of the time spent outdoors and the use of tanning devices for cosmetic purposes by individuals have led to an increase in the incidence of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced skin diseases including the risk of skin cancers. Solar UV radiations are considered as the most prevalent environmental carcinogens, and chronic exposure of the skin to UV leads to squamous and basal cell carcinoma and melanoma in human population. A wide variety of phytochemicals have been reported to have substantial anti-carcinogenic activity because of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Silymarin is one of them and extensively studied for its skin photoprotective capabilities. Silymarin, a flavanolignan, is extracted from the fruits and seeds of milk thistle (Silybum marianum L. Gaertn.), and has been shown to have chemopreventive effects against photocarcinogenesis in mouse tumor models. Topical treatment of silymarin inhibited photocarcinogenesis in mice in terms of tumor incidence, tumor multiplicity and growth of the tumors. Wide range of in vivo mechanistic studies conducted in a variety of mouse models indicated that silymarin has anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties which led to the prevention of photocarcinogenesis in mice. This review summarizes and updates the photoprotective potential of silymarin with the particular emphasis on its in vivo mechanism of actions.

23892749.0,"Human milk contains a high concentration of complex oligosaccharides that influence the composition of the intestinal microbiota in breast-fed infants. Previous studies have indicated that select species such as Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis and Bifidobacterium bifidum can utilize human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) in vitro as the sole carbon source, while the relatively few B. longum subsp. longum and Bifidobacterium breve isolates tested appear less adapted to these substrates. Considering the high frequency at which B. breve is isolated from breast-fed infant feces, we postulated that some B. breve strains can more vigorously consume HMO and thus are enriched in the breast-fed infant gastrointestinal tract. To examine this, a number of B. breve isolates from breast-fed infant feces were characterized for the presence of different glycosyl hydrolases that participate in HMO utilization, as well as by their ability to grow on HMO or specific HMO species such as lacto-N-tetraose (LNT) and fucosyllactose. All B. breve strains showed high levels of growth on LNT and lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT), and, in general, growth on total HMO was moderate for most of the strains, with several strain differences. Growth and consumption of fucosylated HMO were strain dependent, mostly in isolates possessing a glycosyl hydrolase family 29 α-fucosidase. Glycoprofiling of the spent supernatant after HMO fermentation by select strains revealed that all B. breve strains can utilize sialylated HMO to a certain extent, especially sialyl-lacto-N-tetraose. Interestingly, this specific oligosaccharide was depleted before neutral LNT by strain SC95. In aggregate, this work indicates that the HMO consumption phenotype in B. breve is variable; however, some strains display specific adaptations to these substrates, enabling more vigorous consumption of fucosylated and sialylated HMO. These results provide a rationale for the predominance of this species in breast-fed infant feces and contribute to a more accurate picture of the ecology of the developing infant intestinal microbiota.

Milk samples were collected 3 days after delivery (colostrum) and in the third month postpartum (mature milk) by hand expression. The fatty acid composition of the milk samples was determined by gas chromatography. TFA intake corresponded to 1.23 % of total energy value. Total 18:2 TFA accounted for less than 0.5 % of the energy intake. The amount of total 18:1 TFA (mean ± SEM) was 1.9 % ± 0.14 in colostrum and 1.5 % ± 0.2 in mature milk. The total content of n-3 PUFA was inversely correlated with the total content of 18:1 TFA in colostrum. Both in colostrum and in mature milk, vaccenic acid (11t-18:1) was found to be the most abundant 18:1 trans isomer, followed by elaidic acid (9t-18:1), whereas rumenic acid (9c,11t-18:2 CLA) was the predominant 18:2 trans isomer. In conclusion, the levels of TFA of industrial sources found in the mother's diet and breast milk (colostrum and mature milk) showed a decrease in relation to those observed in studies conducted prior to the TFA labeling resolution in Brazil.

30988385.0,"The global increase in resorting to artificial nutritional formulas replacing breastfeeding has been identified among the complex causes of the obesity epidemic in infants and children. One of the factors recently recognized to influence metabolism and weight gain is kynurenic acid (KYNA), an agonist of G protein-coupled receptor (GPR35). Therefore the aim of the study was to determine the concentration of KYNA in artificial nutritional formulas in comparison with its level in human breast milk and to evaluate developmental changes in rats exposed to KYNA enriched diet during the time of breastfeeding. KYNA levels were measured in milk samples from 25 heathy breast-feeding women during the first six months after labor and were compared with 21 time-adjusted nutritional formulas. Animal experiments were performed on male Wistar rats. KYNA was administered in drinking water. The content of KYNA in human milk increases more than 13 times during the time of breastfeeding while its level is significantly lower in artificial formulas. KYNA was detected in breast milk of rats and it was found that the supplementation of rat maternal diet with KYNA in drinking water results in its increase in maternal milk. By means of the immunoblotting technique, GPR35 was evidenced in the mucosa of the jejunum of 1-day-old rats and distinct morphological changes in the jejunum of 21-day-old rats fed by mothers exposed to water supplemented with KYNA were found. A significant reduction of body weight gain of rats postnatally exposed to KYNA supplementation without changes in total body surface and bone mineral density was observed. The rat offspring fed with breast milk with artificially enhanced KYNA content demonstrated a lower mass gain during the first 21 days of life, which indicates that KYNA may act as an anti-obesogen. Further studies are, therefore, warranted to investigate the mechanisms regulating KYNA secretion via breast milk, as well as the influence of breast milk KYNA on mass gain. In the context of lifelong obesity observed worldwide in children fed artificially, our results imply that insufficient amount of KYNA in baby formulas could be considered as one of the factors associated with increased mass gain.",Scientific reports,[],[],Kynurenic acid as the neglected ingredient of commercial baby formulas.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988385,2020,1.0,Milart_19,['HPLC']

22513036.0,"Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are a family of structurally diverse unconjugated glycans that are highly abundant in and unique to human milk. Originally, HMOs were discovered as a prebiotic ""bifidus factor"" that serves as a metabolic substrate for desired bacteria and shapes an intestinal microbiota composition with health benefits for the breast-fed neonate. Today, HMOs are known to be more than just ""food for bugs"". An accumulating body of evidence suggests that HMOs are antiadhesive antimicrobials that serve as soluble decoy receptors, prevent pathogen attachment to infant mucosal surfaces and lower the risk for viral, bacterial and protozoan parasite infections. In addition, HMOs may modulate epithelial and immune cell responses, reduce excessive mucosal leukocyte infiltration and activation, lower the risk for necrotizing enterocolitis and provide the infant with sialic acid as a potentially essential nutrient for brain development and cognition.

17761135.0,"The acidic oligosaccharides of human milk are predominantly sialyloligosaccharides. Pathogens that bind sialic acid-containing glycans on their host mucosal surfaces may be inhibited by human milk sialyloligosaccharides, but testing this hypothesis requires their reliable quantification in milk. Sialyloligosaccharides have been quantified by anion exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), reverse- or normal-phase HPLC, and capillary electrophoresis (CE) of fluorescent derivatives; in milk, these oligosaccharides have been analyzed by high pH anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection and, in our laboratory, by CE with detection at 205nm. The novel method described here uses a running buffer of aqueous 200mM NaH2PO4 (pH 7.05) containing 100mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) mixed with 45% (v/v) methanol to baseline resolve 5 oligosaccharides and separate all 12. This allows automated simultaneous quantification of the 12 major sialyloligosaccharides of human milk in a single 35-min run. This method revealed differences in sialyloligosaccharide concentrations between less and more mature milk from the same donors. Individual donors also varied in expression of sialyloligosaccharides in their milk.

10828177.0,"Insufficient polyamine intake could play a role in the induction of sensitization to dietary allergens. This proposal is based essentially on investigations made in sucking rats and in children. In sucking rats it has been established that oral administration of spermine can induce all the modifications occurring in the digestive tract at weaning. In the intestine events occur in two phases. The early event consists of desquamation of the epithelium resulting from an activation of apoptosis. The late event appears to involve an hormonal cascade in which adrenocorticotropic hormone, cytokines, bombesin and corticosterone are included. Observations in human subjects show that: (1) the spermine and spermidine concentrations are generally lower in infant formulas than in human breast milk. Mothers seem consistently to have relatively high or relatively low concentrations of spermine and spermidine in their milk. These individual variations may be due to diet, lifestyle or genetic background; (2) the probability of developing allergy can reach 80 % if the mean spermine concentration in the milk is lower than 2 nmol/ml milk. It is approximately 0 % if the mean spermine concentration is higher than 13 nmol/ml milk; (3) preliminary results show that the intestinal permeability to macromolecules differs in premature babies when they are fed on breast milk compared with infant formulas (J Senterre, J Rigo, G Forget, G Dandrifosse and N Romain, unpublished results).

The human-milk glycans, which include oligosaccharides in their free and conjugated forms, constitute a major and an innate immunologic mechanism by which human milk protects breast-fed infants against infections. The glycans found in human milk function as soluble receptors that inhibit pathogens from adhering to their target receptors on the mucosal surface of the host gastrointestinal tract. The alpha1,2-linked fucosylated glycans, which require the secretor gene for expression in human milk, are the dominant glycan structure found in the milk of secretor mothers, who constitute the majority ( approximately 80%) of mothers worldwide. In vitro and in vivo binding studies have demonstrated that alpha1,2-linked fucosylated glycans inhibit binding by campylobacter, stable toxin of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and major strains of caliciviruses to their target host cell receptors. Consistent with these findings, recently published epidemiologic data demonstrate that higher relative concentrations of alpha1,2-linked fucosylated glycans in human milk are associated with protection of breast-fed infants against diarrhea caused by campylobacter, caliciviruses, and stable toxin of enterotoxigenic E. coli, and moderate-to-severe diarrhea of all causes.

18952725.0,"Colostrum and milk provide a complete diet for the neonate. In ruminants, colostrum is also the sole source of initial acquired immunity for the offspring. Milk therefore plays an important role in mammalian host defense. In colostrum, the concentration of immunoglobulins is particularly high, with IgG being the major immunoglobulin class present in ruminant milk, in contrast to IgA being the major immunoglobulin present in human milk. Immunoglobulins are transported into mammary secretions via specialized receptors. In addition to immunoglobulins, both colostrum and milk contain viable cells, including neutrophils and macrophages, which secrete a range of immune-related components into milk. These include cytokines and antimicrobial proteins and peptides, such as lactoferrin, defensins, and cathelicidins. Mammary epithelial cells themselves also contribute to the host defense by secreting a range of innate immune effector molecules. A detailed understanding of these proteins and peptides offers great potential to add value to the dairy industry. This is demonstrated by the wide-ranging commercial applications of lactoferrin derived from bovine milk. Knowledge of the immune function of milk, in particular, how the gland responds to pathogens, can be used to boost the concentrations of immune factors in milk through farm management practices and vaccination protocols. The latter approach is currently being used to maximize yields of bovine milk-derived IgA directed at specific antigens for therapeutic and prophylactic use.

9363415.0,"The composition of human milk varies over the course of lactation and in each individual. The volume of breast milk produced is related to the weight of the infant. Human milk is markedly different from cows' milk, both in terms of macronutrients and micronutrients. This includes the types of fatty acids present and factors affecting their absorption. The types of proteins present and their relative proportions and both qualitative and quantitative differences in the non-protein nitrogen fraction. There is much less lactose in cows' milk than breast milk and the oligosaccharide fraction is very different. Their are major differences in content and absorption rates of vitamins and minerals from breast milk compared to cows' milk or formula milk. Vitamin D and vitamin K status are possible problems for the breast-fed infant in certain circumstances. The nutritional status of the mother appears to influence fat concentration and thus the energy content of breast milk as well as its fatty acid composition and immunological properties. There is no coherent evidence, however, that the protein or lactose concentrations are greatly affected. There is some evidence that the concentration of vitamins in the breast milk are influenced by the mother's intake. Minerals are less variable, with the exception of selenium. The response of the infant to human and formula milk differs with respect to endocrine function, stool motility, immune function and renal function. Infant formula milks are designed to mimic human milk as much as possible, but this is unlikely to ever be completely successful. A number of important compositional differences between human milk and formula milk remain.

In recent years, foods containing natural antioxidants are becoming popular all over the world as antioxidants can neutralize and scavenge the free radicals and their harmful effects, which are continuously produced in the biological body. Uncontrolled free radicals activity can lead to oxidative stresses, which have been implicated in breakdown of vital biochemical compounds such as lipids, protein, DNA which may lead to diabetes, accelerated ageing, carcinogenesis and cardiovascular diseases. Antioxidant capacity of milk and milk products is mainly due to sulfur containing amino acids, such as cysteine, phosphate, vitamins A, E, carotenoids, zinc, selenium, enzyme systems, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, milk oligosaccharides and peptides that are produced during fermentation and cheese ripening. Antioxidant activity of milk and dairy products can be enhanced by phytochemicals supplementation while fermented dairy products have been reported contained higher antioxidant capacity as compared to the non-fermented dairy products.

Therefore, we studied the amounts of polyamines supplied by breast milk (varying among mothers) or infant formula feeding, up to day 30 postpartum, in the faeces of newborns.

In breast milk, polyamines and isoamylamine (a primary amine), with inter-individual variations, increased over time (with a higher content of spermidine; no other amines were present). Overall, they were much higher than in infant formula. By the 2nd week after birth, polyamines, cadaverine and tyramine, but not isoamylamine, were higher in the faeces of those fed infant formula compared with those fed breast milk.

Banked donor milk mean values (in weight/volume) were found to be 1.16%+/-0.25% for protein, 3.22%+/-1.00% for fat, 7.80%+/-0.88% for lactose, and mean total energy was 65+/-11 kcal/dL.

20668239.0,"The colonization process of the infant gut microbiome has been called chaotic, but this view could reflect insufficient documentation of the factors affecting the microbiome. We performed a 2.5-y case study of the assembly of the human infant gut microbiome, to relate life events to microbiome composition and function. Sixty fecal samples were collected from a healthy infant along with a diary of diet and health status. Analysis of >300,000 16S rRNA genes indicated that the phylogenetic diversity of the microbiome increased gradually over time and that changes in community composition conformed to a smooth temporal gradient. In contrast, major taxonomic groups showed abrupt shifts in abundance corresponding to changes in diet or health. Community assembly was nonrandom: we observed discrete steps of bacterial succession punctuated by life events. Furthermore, analysis of ≈ 500,000 DNA metagenomic reads from 12 fecal samples revealed that the earliest microbiome was enriched in genes facilitating lactate utilization, and that functional genes involved in plant polysaccharide metabolism were present before the introduction of solid food, priming the infant gut for an adult diet. However, ingestion of table foods caused a sustained increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes, elevated fecal short chain fatty acid levels, enrichment of genes associated with carbohydrate utilization, vitamin biosynthesis, and xenobiotic degradation, and a more stable community composition, all of which are characteristic of the adult microbiome.

23861770.0,"Aware of the important benefits of human milk, most U.S. women initiate breastfeeding but difficulties with milk supply lead some to quit earlier than intended. Yet, the contribution of maternal physiology to lactation difficulties remains poorly understood. Human milk fat globules, by enveloping cell contents during their secretion into milk, are a rich source of mammary cell RNA. Here, we pair this non-invasive mRNA source with RNA-sequencing to probe the milk fat layer transcriptome during three stages of lactation: colostral, transitional, and mature milk production. The resulting transcriptomes paint an exquisite portrait of human lactation. The resulting transcriptional profiles cluster not by postpartum day, but by milk Na:K ratio, indicating that women sampled during similar postpartum time frames could be at markedly different stages of gene expression. Each stage of lactation is characterized by a dynamic range (10(5)-fold) in transcript abundances not previously observed with microarray technology. We discovered that transcripts for isoferritins and cathepsins are strikingly abundant during colostrum production, highlighting the potential importance of these proteins for neonatal health. Two transcripts, encoding β-casein (CSN2) and α-lactalbumin (LALBA), make up 45% of the total pool of mRNA in mature lactation. Genes significantly expressed across all stages of lactation are associated with making, modifying, transporting, and packaging milk proteins. Stage-specific transcripts are associated with immune defense during the colostral stage, up-regulation of the machinery needed for milk protein synthesis during the transitional stage, and the production of lipids during mature lactation. We observed strong modulation of key genes involved in lactose synthesis and insulin signaling. In particular, protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, F (PTPRF) may serve as a biomarker linking insulin resistance with insufficient milk supply. This study provides the methodology and reference data set to enable future targeted research on the physiological contributors of sub-optimal lactation in humans.

Thirty-three healthy, lactating Brazilian women donated milk samples; of these, twenty-four also donated blood samples in an observational cross-sectional study. Breast milk fatty acid composition presented several associations with NEFA and EM composition, which explained most (> or =50 %) of the variability of selected milk PUFA, long-chain PUFA and CLA. Milk CLA was associated with fatty acids that are markers of dairy fat intake in the diet, NEFA and EM. In general, breast milk n-3 fatty acids and CLA, but not n-6 fatty acids, were associated with EM composition, whereas both the n-6 and n-3 fatty acids and CLA in milk were associated with NEFA composition, possibly owing to its role as a direct source of fatty acids for breast milk.

28777356.0,"Adequate nutrition is particularly important during pregnancy since it is needed not only for maintaining the health of the mother, but also determines the course of pregnancy and its outcome, fetus development as well as the child's health after birth and during the later period of life. Data coming from epidemiological and interventions studies support the observation that carotenoids intake provide positive health effects in adults and the elderly population. These health effects are the result of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Recent studies have also demonstrated the significant role of carotenoids during pregnancy and infancy. Some studies indicate a correlation between carotenoid status and lower risk of pregnancy pathologies induced by intensified oxidative stress, but results of these investigations are equivocal. Carotenoids have been well studied in relation to their beneficial role in the prevention of preeclampsia. It is currently hypothesized that carotenoids can play an important role in the prevention of preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction. Carotenoid status in the newborn depends on the nutritional status of the mother, but little is known about the transfer of carotenoids from the mother to the fetus. Carotenoids are among the few nutrients found in breast milk, in which the levels are determined by the mother's diet. Nutritional status of the newborn directly depends on its diet. Both mix feeding and artificial feeding may cause depletion of carotenoids since infant formulas contain only trace amounts of these compounds. Carotenoids, particularly lutein and zeaxanthin play a significant role in the development of vision and nervous system (among others, they are important for the development of retina as well as energy metabolism and brain electrical activity).

14991268.0,"In mammals the composition of milk changes during early lactation, with a rapid decline of fat-soluble vitamins and a continuous increase in total lipids. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well understood, but might involve selective mechanisms related to mammary uptake or secretion into the milk. Since carotenoids are specifically distributed among the lipoprotein fractions in plasma, the simultaneous determination of carotenoids in plasma, lipoprotein fractions and milk might offer an opportunity to gain insight into this phenomenon. In 21 healthy mothers carotenoids in plasma and lipoprotein fractions were investigated at day 2 and 19 and milk on day 4 and 19 after delivery. Plasma levels of alpha-tocopherol and cholesterol as well as lutein, zeaxanthin and cryptoxanthin were significantly lower later in lactation (day 19) than shortly after birth (P < 0.01). The stage of lactation had no effect on the distribution of carotenoids and alpha-tocopherol among the plasma lipoprotein fractions. In milk, triacylglycerol increased (P < 0.01). In contrast, levels of carotenoids, alpha-tocopherol and vitamin A were highest in colostrum and declined (P < 0.01). Because the magnitude of decrease was not the same in all carotenoids, the carotenoid pattern changed substantially. In colostrum the carotenoid pattern resembled those of plasma and the low-density lipoprotein fraction. In mature milk it was similar to the pattern found in the high density lipoprotein fraction. Based on these observations a selective mechanism might be responsible for the transfer of these components in milk involving different lipoprotein fractions at specific times of lactation.",European journal of nutrition,"['D000328', 'D002338', 'D003126', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D007774', 'D008074', 'D008895', 'D013997', 'D024502']","['Adult', 'Carotenoids', 'Colostrum', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lactation', 'Lipoproteins', 'Milk, Human', 'Time Factors', 'alpha-Tocopherol']","Effect of the stage of lactation in humans on carotenoid levels in milk, blood plasma and plasma lipoprotein fractions.","[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000502', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, 'physiology', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14991268,2004,1.0,Schweigert_04,['HPLC']

29344587.0,"Red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) contains a variety of polyphenols including anthocyanins and ellagitannins. Red raspberry polyphenols absorbed in different forms (parent compounds, degradants or microbial metabolites) are subject to xenobiotic metabolism in the intestine, liver, and/or kidney, forming methylate, glucuronide, and sulfate conjugated metabolites. Upon acute exposure, (poly)phenol/metabolite presence in the blood depends mainly on intestinal absorption, enterohepatic circulation, and metabolism by resident microbiota. However, chronic exposure to red raspberry polyphenols may alter metabolite patterns depending on adaptions in the xenobiotic machinery and/or microbiota composition. Understanding the metabolic fate of these compounds and their composition in different biological specimens relative to the exposure time/dose will aid in designing future health benefit studies, including the mechanism of action studies. The present exploratory study applied ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) and triple quadrupole (QQQ) mass spectrometries to characterize red raspberry polyphenols in fruit and then their appearance, including metabolites in human biological samples (plasma, urine and breast milk) after the chronic intake of red raspberries.

HPP at 600 MPa for 2.5 min resulted in the maintenance of IgA and losses of IgM and IgG (21% for both). The pressure treatments at 600 MPa for 15 and 30 min led to similar or higher losses than pasteurisation. D-values (min) for Igs ranged from 4941 to 452 at 400 MPa and from 235 to 40 at 600 MPa.

16011458.0,"Breastfed infants have lower morbidity and mortality due to diarrhea than those fed artificially. This had been attributed primarily to the secretory antibodies and prebiotic factors in human milk. Oligosaccharides are the third largest component of human milk. They were initially considered to be functionless by-products of glycoprotein and glycolipid synthesis during milk production. However, in the past few decades it has become apparent that the human milk oligosaccharides are composed of thousands of components, at least some of which protect against pathogens. Oligosaccharide protection against infectious agents may result in part from their prebiotic characteristics, but is thought to be primarily due to their inhibition of pathogen binding to host cell ligands. Most human milk oligosaccharides are fucosylated, and their production depends on enzymes encoded by the genes associated with expression of the Lewis blood group system. The expression of specific fucosylated oligosaccharides in milk thus varies in relation to maternal Lewis blood group type, and is significantly associated with the risk of infectious disease in breastfed infants. Specific fucosylated moieties of oligosaccharides and related glycoconjugates (glycans) are able to inhibit binding and disease by specific pathogens. This review presents the argument that specific glycans, especially the oligosaccharides, are the major constituent of an innate immune system of human milk whereby the mother protects her infant from enteric and other pathogens through breastfeeding. The large input of energy expended by the mother in the synthesis of milk oligosaccharides is consistent with the human reproductive strategy of large parental input into rearing relatively few offspring through a prolonged period of maturation. These protective glycans may prove useful as a basis for the development of novel prophylactic and therapeutic agents that inhibit diseases caused by mucosal pathogens.",Annual review of nutrition,"['D001424', 'D001942', 'D003968', 'D005260', 'D005643', 'D006801', 'D007109', 'D007223', 'D007231', 'D007410', 'D008895', 'D009844', 'D011134', 'D019936', 'D014777']","['Bacterial Infections', 'Breast Feeding', 'Diarrhea, Infantile', 'Female', 'Fucose', 'Humans', 'Immunity', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Milk, Human', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Polysaccharides', 'Probiotics', 'Virus Diseases']",Human milk glycans protect infants against enteric pathogens.,"['Q000517', None, 'Q000382', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000382', 'Q000737', 'Q000502', 'Q000502', None, 'Q000517']","['prevention & control', None, 'microbiology', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'microbiology', 'chemistry', 'physiology', 'physiology', None, 'prevention & control']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16011458,2005,0.0,Newburg_05,[]

Corrections were made for losses of amino acids which were presumed to occur during acid hydrolysis, using a non-linear mathematical model that describes the simultaneous processes of amino acid yield and decay. The mean amino acid composition of the human milk was found to be similar to previously reported estimates, although the cysteine content of the human milk in the present study was 20% higher than the average literature estimate. True (corrected for endogenous amino acid excretions) ileal amino acid digestibility of human milk was determined using the 3-week-old piglet as a model animal for the human infant. The piglets were given either human milk (n 6) or a protein-free diet (n 6) for a 6 d experimental period. Cr2O3 was added as an indigestible marker, to both the human milk and protein-free diet. At the end of the experimental period the piglets were anaesthetized and samples of digesta removed from the terminal ileum of each piglet. After sampling the piglets were killed. Endogenous ileal excretions of amino acids were determined in piglets fed on the protein-free diet. The true digestibilities of total N and amino acid N were 88% and 95% respectively.

The composition of breast milk changes according to the newborn infant's needs for passive protection. In addition, substances in breast milk can actively stimulate development of the newborn's host defenses to provide continued mucosal protection after breastfeeding is terminated. Later I present several specific examples of the development of intestinal host defenses due to breastfeeding. An important function of early breastfeeding is its anti-inflammatory effect on the immature, excessive inflammatory response in newborns. Several components of breast milk can reduce the inflammatory response to stimuli in the newborn intestine.

The retention of these proteins was also compared using a commercially available bottle immersion or holding chamber system. After pasteurization at 62.5 degrees C for 30 min, the retention across all three systems was 72.3 +/- 3.6%, 21.8 +/- 3.3%, and 39.4 +/- 11.5% for sIgA, lactoferrin, and lysozyme, respectively (n = 22). The retention of all three proteins was at least 90% when human milk was pasteurized at 57 degrees C for 30 min, and this temperature was also effective at removing 99.9% of all inoculated bacterial species.

The concentration of metabolites (lactose, glucose and urea), electrolytes and proteins (total protein, alpha-lactalbumin, lactoferrin, albumin, IgA, IgG and IgM) were measured in small samples of mammary secretion (0 . 5-5 . 0 ml). Colostrum during late pregnancy contained higher concentrations of proteins and lower concentrations of metabolites than milk in established lactation. Of the electrolytes, the concentrations of sodium, chloride and magnesium were higher, whereas potassium and calcium were lower in colostrum than in milk. The osmolality of the secretion remained relatively constant over the pre-partum and post-partum period.

Breast-feeding can reduce the rate of serious gastroenteritis in infants; however, the degrees of protection offered against rotavirus infection vary in different populations. The mechanisms associated with milk-mediated protection against viral gastroenteritis have not been fully elucidated. We have isolated a macromolecular component of human milk that inhibits the replication of rotaviruses in tissue culture and prevents the development of gastroenteritis in an animal model system. Purification of the component indicates that the antiviral activity is associated with an acidic fraction (pI = 4.0-4.6), which is free of detectable immunoglobulins. Furthermore, high levels of antiviral activity are associated with an affinity-purified complex of human milk mucin. Deglycosylation of the mucin complex results in the loss of antiviral activity. Further purification indicated that rotavirus specifically binds to the milk mucin complex as well as to the 46-kD glycoprotein component of the complex. Binding to the 46-kD component was substantially reduced after chemical hydrolysis of sialic acid.

Epidemiologic studies show consistently a cancer protective effect of fruit and vegetable consumption, but there is little understanding of which phytochemicals account for this observation. Commonly studied antioxidant micronutrients are less consistently correlated with cancer protection relative to the food groups themselves, suggesting that other phytochemicals or a combination of food products play key roles in preventing cancer. We investigated the effects of the predominant dietary flavonoids and isoflavonoids at inhibiting neoplastic transformation induced by 3-methylcholanthrene in C3H 10T1/2 murine fibroblasts. We found that most phenolic agents tested were equal to or superior to known chemopreventive agents such as carotenoids or vitamins in effectiveness. Hesperetin, hesperidin and catechin were the most potent agents among the flavonoids tested, inhibiting transformation completely when applied at 1.0 microM after exposure to the carcinogen. Structure-activity comparison revealed that among the compounds tested, flavonoids with a vicinal diphenol structure in ring 'B' and a saturated 'C' ring exhibited the strongest effects. Most agents tested showed dose-dependent patterns. Interestingly, the soy isoflavonoids were weakly active except when applied in combination, suggesting a synergistic effect. In addition, HPLC techniques were developed for determining the bioavailability of isoflavonoids in human biological fluids including urine, plasma and breast milk. We observed a relatively fast absorption, distribution and elimination of isoflavonoids including a biphasic pattern probably due to enterohepatic circulation.

Crude protein also contained 30 to 35 mg/ 100 mL urea and 41 to 48 mg/ 100 mL free amino acids as non-protein nitrogen components. The ratio of essential to non-essential amino acids remained constant throughout the lactation period in spite of a decline in amino acid content. The amino acid composition per 1 g of nitrogen varied during the lactation period. The differences of these lactational changing patterns of individual amino acids were probably reflected by variation of the protein composition during lactation. The sum of free amino acid content ranged from 43 to 50 mg/100 mL in Taipei and 40 to 45 mg/100 ml, in Kaohsiung.

Five general pathways have been described for transport of proteins, lipids, ions, nutrients and water into milk. Four of these pathways are transcellular, involving transport across at least two membrane barriers; the fifth is paracellular and allows direct exchange of interstitial and milk components. Solute transport by these pathways is mediated by a diverse, and complex array of transport and secretory processes that are regulated by hormonal, developmental, and physiological factors.

27490567.0,"When a mother's milk is unavailable, the best alternative is donor milk (DM). Milk delivered to Human Milk Banks should be pasteurized in order to inactivate the microbial agents that may be present. Currently, pasteurization, performed at 62.5 °C for 30 min (Holder Pasteurization, HoP), is recommended for this purpose in international guidelines. Several studies have been performed to investigate the effects of HoP on the properties of DM. The present paper has the aim of reviewing the published papers on this topic, and to provide a comparison of the reported variations of biologically-active DM components before and after HoP. This review was performed by searching the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL and Cochrane Library databases. Studies that clearly identified the HoP parameters and compared the same DM samples, before and after pasteurization, were focused on. A total of 44 articles satisfied the above criteria, and were therefore selected. The findings from the literature report variable results. A possible explanation for this may be the heterogeneity of the test protocols that were applied. Moreover, the present review spans more than five decades, and modern pasteurizers may be able to modify the degradation kinetics for heat-sensitive substances, compared to older ones. Overall, the data indicate that HoP affects several milk components, although it is difficult to quantify the degradation degree.

2181825.0,"Human milk is characterized not only by a complex host defense system that prevents the colonization and proliferation of common microbial pathogens that may pervade the alimentary tract and respiratory tract of the infant but also by a paucity of inflammatory agents and an array of anti-phlogistic factors. Clinical observations support the notion that the protection provided by human milk involves not only antimicrobial factors, but also anti-inflammatory agents. The major anti-inflammatory agents include enzymes that degrade mediators of inflammation, anti-proteases, lysozyme, lactoferrin, secretory IgA and a number of antioxidants including cysteine, ascorbate, alpha-tocopherol, and beta-carotene. It is pertinent that most of these factors are either absent or poorly represented in cow's milk or other artificial feedings that substitute for breast feeding and that the attainment of adult serum levels of some of these antioxidants in early infancy is dependent upon breast feeding. It may be that the provision of these antioxidants may help to protect the recipient's developing immunologic system which is quite susceptible to oxidant damage. The absence of breast feeding will thus deprive the infant of valuable protection against common enteric-respiratory disorders and their inflammatory consequences. It should be pointed out that the protective systems in human milk including the anti-inflammatory components may not be completely delineated, and that little is known of the in vivo fate of the factors and precisely how they protect the recipient.

Milk vitamins D and K contents, even in apparently well-nourished women, may not always provide adequate amounts for infants. Investigations provide evidence that human milk possesses many unique characteristics and that maternal and environmental influences are stronger than previously recognized and appreciated. A complete body of knowledge does not exist to serve as a basis for dietary recommendations to ensure optimal nutrition for mothers and infants. The success of lactation usually is measured in terms of infant performance, and cost and consequence to the mother are seldom considered. Human milk feeding is recommended for the entire first year of life, but few studies focus on the nursing dyad for more than 3 months' duration. Continued study is needed so that nutritional adequacy may be maintained and appropriate dietary guidance can be provided. When human milk feeding is not practiced, modern and reliable data on human milk constituents and their significance to infants also are essential for the preparation of formulas, especially those not based on bovine milk.

Fifty-two mother and infant pairs participated when the infants were three-months old. Milk cortisol levels were assessed and each mother completed the Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ), a widely used parent-report measure of infant temperament. Analyses revealed a positive association between milk cortisol and the negative affectivity dimension of the IBQ (partial r=.37, p<.01). No correlation was found between elevated cortisol levels and the surgency/extraversion or the orienting/regulation dimensions. Further, the positive association between increased maternal milk cortisol and negative affectivity was present among girls (β=.59, p<.01), but not among boys. (Although, the sex by milk cortisol interaction term was not statistically significant, suggesting that these results require replication.) Environmental factors such as maternal demographics and negative maternal affect (depression and perceived stress) at the time of assessment did not account for the positive association.

Human milk is the major food in infancy and may thus profoundly influence the composition of the gut flora. Oligosaccharides in breast milk survive the passage through the stomach and are utilized by the gut microbiota. As the relationship between breast feeding and childhood allergy is controversial we hypothesized that the composition of oligosaccharides in breast milk might explain the controversy. Nine of the most abundant neutral oligosaccharides in human milk were analysed in colostrum samples from allergic and non-allergic women and related to subsequent development of allergy in their children. The carbohydrate fraction of the colostrum was separated by gel permeation chromatography and neutral oligosaccharides, tri- to hexasaccharides were collected. Neutral oligosaccharides were analysed with high-performance liquid chromatography. There was a large variation in the concentration of neutral oligosaccharides in colostrum, which could not be explained by the allergic status of the women. Allergic children consumed higher amounts of neutral oligosaccharides in total, although not significantly (p = 0.12). When different oligosaccharides were analysed separately, there was no significant difference in consumption between the infants who developed atopic allergy later (n = 9) and infants who did not (n = 11).

15736916.0,"There is increased consumer awareness that foods contain microcomponents that may have beneficial effects on health maintenance and disease prevention. In milk fat these functional food components include EPA, DHA, and CLA. The opportunity to enhance the content of these FA in milk has improved as a result of recent advances that have better defined the interrelationships between rumen fermentation, lipid metabolism, and milk fat synthesis. Dietary lipids undergo extensive hydrolysis and biohydrogenation in the rumen. Milk fat is predominantly TG, and de novo FA synthesis and the uptake of circulating FA contribute nearly equal amounts (molar basis) to the FA in milk fat. Transfer of dietary EPA and DHA to milk fat is very low (<4%); this is, to a large extent, related to their extensive biohydrogenation in the rumen, and also partly due to the fact that they are not transported in the plasma lipid fractions that serve as major mammary sources of FA uptake (TG and nonesterified FA). Milk contains over 20 isomers of CLA but the predominant one is cis-9,trans-11 (75-90% of total CLA). Biomedical studies with animal models have shown that this isomer has anticarcinogenic and anti-atherogenic activities. cis-9,trans-11-CLA is produced as an intermediate in the rumen biohydrogenation of linoleic acid but not of linolenic acid. However, it is only a transient intermediate, and the major source of milk fat CLA is from endogenous synthesis. Vaccenic acid, produced as a rumen biohydrogenation intermediate from both linoleic acid and linolenic acid, is the substrate, and delta9-desaturase in the mammary gland and other tissues catalyzes the reaction. Diet can markedly affect milk fat CLA content, and there are also substantial differences among individual cows. Thus, strategies to enhance milk fat CLA involve increasing rumen outflow of vaccenic acid and increasing delta9-desaturase activity, and through these, several-fold increases in the content of CLA in milk fat can be routinely achieved. Overall, concentrations of CLA, and to a lesser extent EPA and DHA, can be significantly enhanced through the use of diet formulation and nutritional management of dairy cows.",Lipids,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D005227', 'D015525', 'D005260', 'D006017', 'D006023', 'D006262', 'D006801', 'D019787', 'D008892']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-3', 'Female', 'Glycolipids', 'Glycoproteins', 'Health', 'Humans', 'Linoleic Acid', 'Milk']",Modifying milk fat composition of dairy cows to enhance fatty acids beneficial to human health.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000494', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000494', 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'analysis', 'pharmacology', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'pharmacology', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15736916,2005,0.0,Lock_04b,[]

However, it started about a century ago with the observation that oligosaccharides might be growth factors for a so-called bifidus flora in breast-fed infants and extends to the recent finding of cell adhesion molecules in human milk. The latter are involved in inflammatory events recognizing carbohydrate sequences that also can be found in human milk. The similarities between epithelial cell surface carbohydrates and oligosaccharides in human milk strengthen the idea that specific interactions of those oligosaccharides with pathogenic microorganisms do occur preventing the attachment of microbes to epithelial cells. HMOs may act as soluble receptors for different pathogens, thus increasing the resistance of breast-fed infants. However, we need to know more about the metabolism of oligosaccharides in the gastrointestinal tract.

However, different self-selected diets in different geographic locations seem to have little effect on the milk content of 20 and 22 carbon long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCP), with the exception of relatively high n-3 fatty acids in the milk of African women consuming a large proportion of dietary fat from sea fish. Even then, docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3), and not eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3), remains the predominant n-3 LCP in milk.

There were no significant differences in milk composition among species within either Eulemur or Otolemur, but the four genera for which multiple samples were available (Eulemur, Varecia, Otolemur, and Nycticebus) exhibited large composition differences. Eulemur milk was, on average, very dilute (9.9% dry matter) and low in energy (0.49 kcal/g). These milks contained 0.9% fat, 1.2% protein, and 8.4% carbohydrate on a fresh weight basis. Protein energy comprised only about 15% of total milk energy. Varecia had significantly higher dry matter (13.5%), fat (3.2%), protein (4.2%), gross energy (0.80 kcal/g), and protein energy:total energy ratio (28%) than Eulemur. Milks of the lorisoid genera Otolemur and Nycticebus were very similar, and both had significantly higher dry matter (18.3, 16.3%), fat (7.6, 7.0%), and gross energy concentration (1.27, 1.13 kcal/g) than either lemuroid genus. Otolemur milk was higher in protein than Nycticebus milk. We conclude that lorises, bushbabies, and perhaps cheirogaleids produce relatively rich, energy-dense milks in comparison with anthropoid primates. However, dilute milks appear to be uniformly found among species of Eulemur and perhaps in Lemur catta. The milk of Varecia (and perhaps Hapalemur) is intermediate in composition. Differences in milk composition among prosimians may be related to differences in maternal care: prosimians that carry their young during lactation produce more dilute milks than do species which leave their young unattended for prolonged periods.

,"The fatty acid composition of bovine milk fat can be substantially altered by feeding lipid sources which alter the fatty acid profile of lipid entering the intestine from the rumen. As long-chain fatty acids of dietary origin can be incorporated directly into milk fat the opportunity exists to alter the ratio of short and long-chain fatty acids as well as the degree of saturation of milk fat. In practice our ability to alter the fatty acid profile of milk fat is limited not by the synthetic capacity of the mammary gland, but rather by the challenge of achieving effective protection of unsaturated dietary fatty acids from biohydrogenation in the rumen, as well as keeping the level of polyunsaturated fatty acids within the range where the organoleptic quality and shelf-life of milk and dairy products are not compromised.

,"Although the biochemistry of milk from mothers giving birth prematurely has been described in some detail, it was not known whether premature birth would affect vitamin D status of mothers, the vitamin D activity of milk or the concentration of vitamin D binding protein in milk. In the present study, plasma and milk samples were collected from eight mothers giving birth prematurely and compared to samples obtained from nine mothers giving birth at term. Vitamin D intake from milk and vitamin D supplements was at least 400 IU/day in all mothers. Complete 24-hour expressions of milk were collected between 14 and 21 days postpartum. No differences were observed in plasma D2 (5.1+0.7 and 3.7+1.0 ng/ml, mean±SEM) or milk D2 (0.19±0.06 and 0.12±0.02 ng/ml) in term versus preterm groups, respectively.

Differences in the synthesis and/or transport of vitamin D and DBP which are reflected in PT milk and plasma levels in the early postpartum period may relate to cutaneous synthesis or abbreviated gestational stage. Based on the vitamin D sterols measured in this study, the total vitamin D activity in human milk in the first month of lactation averaged 80±9 IU/L for preterm milk and 60±7 IU/L for term milk, both values which are in excess of the often quoted value for human milk vitamin D of 22 IU/L.",,,[],,,,,,1.0,Atkinson_87b,['HPLC']
,"This review summarises the known effects of forages, animal fats or marine oils on bovine milk fat secretion and composition. Special attention is given to fatty acids that could play a positive role for human health, such as butyric acid, oleic acid, C18 to C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). The efficiency of the transfer of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from diet to milk is reviewed. Milk fat from pasture fed cows seems to be higher in linolenic acid than milk fat from cows receiving preserved grass or maize, but the magnitude of this difference is limited. Indirect comparisons show that milk fat from maize silage diets is richer in short-chain FA and linoleic acid when compared to grass silage diets. Compared to fresh grass, grass silage favours myristic and palmitic acids at the expense of mono- and polyunsaturated FA, including CLA. Protected tallow allows for a large increase in milk fat yield, and in the percentage of milk stearic and oleic acids, at the expense of medium chain FA. Non-protected tallow has a similar effect on medium chain FA without increasing so much C18 FA yield, which explains that it does not increase milk fat yield. Dose–response curves of milk CLA are reviewed for marine oil supplements, as well as the relationship between milk CLA and trans-C18:1 contents. The potential of marine oil supplementation to increase the mean CLA content in cow milk fat is large (more than 300% above basal values). A specific role for dietary C20:5 n-3 in the sharp decrease in milk fat secretion after fish oil supplementation is suggested. However, there is a need to evaluate how the different feeding strategies could change the other aspects of milk fat quality, such as taste, oxidative stability or manufacturing value.",,,[],,,,,,0.0,Chilliard_01,[]

,"When it comes to feeding the newborn, human milk is, from an evolutionary perspective, the biological norm, the time-tested standard of care. The health benefits to the infant of breast-feeding have been amply documented; numerous studies strongly indicate significantly decreased risks of infection, allergy, asthma, arthritis, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and various cancers in both childhood and adulthood. Among the more fundamental disadvantages of not being breastfed is a loss of immunologic protection afforded by maternal colostrum, a “pre-milk” fluid secreted only during the first days after delivery, as well as numerous other bioactive factors that help protect the infant through the first two years of life, when the immune and nervous systems are incompletely developed.

,"Background and objectives: Many studies indicate that the maternal diet is an important factor affecting human milk composition. Human milk composition among lactating women in Latvia, as well as the maternal diet during lactation, has not been sufficiently studied. The aim of this research was to assess dietary habits and macronutrient intake among lactating women in Latvia and to examine the effect of diet on human milk composition. Materials and Methods: Research was conducted between November 2016 and December 2017. Mature human milk samples (n = 61) along with a 72h food diary, a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and a questionnaire about maternal and infant characteristics were obtained from voluntary women who were recruited via an invitation published in a social media member group for nursing mothers. Fat content in human milk was determined by LVS ISO 2446:2008, protein content was determined by LVS EN ISO 8968-1:2014, lactose was determined by ISO 22662:2007, and the fatty acid profile was analyzed using gas chromatography. Dietary data were evaluated using the Finnish food composition database Fineli, release 19 (3 March 2018). Results: Median values for fat, protein, and lactose in mature human milk were 4.40%, 1.08%, and 6.52%, respectively. Predominant fatty acids in human milk were oleic acid (C18:1 n9c), palmitic acid (C16:0), and linoleic acid (C18:2 n6c) at 34.60%, 24.00%, and 11.00% of total fatty acids, respectively. The trans elaidic acid (C18:1 n9t) level was <0.10% in all human milk samples. Significant, positive associations (p < 0.05) were found between maternal dietary intake of linoleic, α-linolenic, docosahexaenoic, total cis-monounsaturated, total cis-polyunsaturated, and total n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, the ratio of n-6/n-3, and the level of these fatty acids in human milk. Total energy and carbohydrate intake among participants were lower, but total fat, saturated fat, and sugar intake were higher than recommended. Protein, linoleic acid, and α-linolenic acid intake were adequate, but docosahexaenoic acid intake was noticeably lower than recommended. Women should be supported with information regarding their nutritional needs during lactation and the possible impact of diet on human milk composition. Conclusion: Macronutrient (fat, protein, and lactose) content in human milk is not affected by maternal diet. Conversely, the human milk fatty acid profile is affected by the immediate diet consumed by the mother. Habitual dietary habits can also impact the fatty acid profile of human milk.",,,[],,,,,,1.0,Aumeistere_19,[]
,"Introduction: Recent research findings support the assumption that the development of chronic diseases in adults is greatly influenced by the supply of nutrients in the uterus and the nutrition, nourishment of the early, toddler ages. Aim: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the nutritional habits of infants and toddlers aged 0-3 in Hungary, and to identify the most typical problems of their nutrition, to get to know and provide the necessary data for the modification and modernization of feeding/nutrition recommendations for infants and young children in Hungary. Method: The study was carried out with the professional coordination of the Hungarian Dietetic Association (MDOSZ) in the framework of industry research between June and August 2015, in the 0-3-year-old population, in the cities Budapest, Debrecen, Győr, Szeged and Pécs. The survey was conducted with anthropometric measurements and validated by three-day dietary log templates. Results: 18.6% of infants aged 4 to 12 months (n = 220) had values below 10th percentile, 10% were between 85-97th percentiles and 3% were above 97th percentile. 15% of children aged 12-24 months (n = 227) had a body mass index (BMI) below 10th percentile (underweight), 14% were between 85-97th percentile (overweight) and 2.6% had BMI over the 97th percentile (obese). 70% of 25-36-month-old children (n = 184) had normal BMI, 4% were overweight, 2% obese, 24% underweight. Based on the Hungarian reference value, 10.9% of the 4-12-month-old children, 20% of the 1-2-year-olds, 47% of the 2-3-year-olds were in high protein intake group. However, compared to the 2013's reference values of the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) recommendation, 100% of the children belong to the high protein intake group in all age groups. Conclusion: Although the EFSA recommendation - based on the WHO/FAO/UNU macro- and micronutrient intake values in 2007 - defines the recommended intake quantities, the results in the sample did not support its overall reliability.
