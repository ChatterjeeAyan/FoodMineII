29693456,"After gas chromatography and mass spectrometry of prepared methanolic extract of Allium sativum, 40 laboratory BALB/c mice were infected intraperitoneally by injection of 1,500 viable protoscoleces. Five months after infection, the infected mice were allocated into four treatment groups, including 1- Albendazole (100Â mg/kg); 2- Allium sativum methanolic extract (10Â mL/L); 3- A. sativum methanolic extract (10Â mL/L) + Albendazole (50Â mg /kg); and 4- untreated control group. After 30Â days of daily treatment, total number and weight of cysts and size of the largest cyst as well as blood serum bilirubin and liver enzymes were compared between the mice of different groups. The total number and weight of cysts and size of the largest cyst were significantly lower in treated groups A. sativum 10Â mL/L + Albendazole 50 and Albendazole 100 in comparison to those of the control group (p < 0.05). The activity of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) enzyme and bilirubin concentration were significantly lower in the mice treated with A. sativum 10Â mL/L and A. sativum 10Â mL/L + Albendazole 50, when compared to the control group. In addition, bilirubin concentration revealed significant decrease in A. sativum 10Â mL/L and A. sativum 10Â mL/L + Albendazole 50 groups, when compared to the Albendazole group. In conclusion, administration of A. sativum 10Â mL/L improved the anti-hydatidosis activity of Albendazole 50Â mg /kg, due to parasitological effects similar to Albendazole 100Â mg /kg but less hepatotoxic effects.",Allium Sativum Methanolic Extract (garlic) Improve Therapeutic Efficacy of Albendazole Against Hydatid Cyst: In Vivo Study.,[],[],1.0,garlic,0.25,"['alanine', 'Allium', 'bilirubin', '3- A. sativum methanolic extract', '2- Allium sativum methanolic extract', 'Albendazole']",1,16
29653182,"Meju, a cooked and fermented soy bean based food product, is used as a major ingredient in Korean traditional fermented foods such as Doenjang. We developed a novel type of Meju using single and combined extracts of Allium sativum (garlic clove), Nelumbo nucifera (lotus leaves), and Ginkgo biloba (ginkgo leaves) at 1% and 10% concentrations to improve the safety of Meju-based fermented products. Biogenic amines (BAs) in protein-rich fermented food products pose considerable toxical risks. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of adding selected plant extracts in Meju samples during fermentation. Nine BAs, including tryptamine, 2-phenylethylamine, putrescine, cadaverine, agmatine, histamine, tyramine, spermidine and spermine, were isolated from Meju samples after sample derivatization with dansyl chloride and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. As a result, all tested Meju samples with added plant extracts showed total BAs levels in the range of 20.12â¯Â±â¯2.03 to 118.42â¯Â±â¯10.68 mg/100â¯g, which were below the safety limit set by various regulatory authorities (USFDA/KFDA/EFSA). However, among all tested Meju samples, LOM10 (Meju fermented with Nelumbo nucifera at 10% concentration) showed higher levels of BAs content than others either due to batch-to-batch variability or reduced beneficial microorganisms and/or due to increase in BA forming microorganisms. Also, none of the samples showed the aflatoxin level above the detection limit. Furthermore, all the tested Meju samples improved microbial safety as confirmed by the complete absence of Salmonella species and Staphylococcus aureus.

28932845,"Garlic (A. sativum) contains a large number of small sulphur (S)-containing metabolites, which are important for its taste and smell and vary with A. sativum variety and growth conditions. This study was designed to investigate the influence of different sulphur-fertilization regimes on low molecular weight S-species by attempting the first sulphur mass balance in A. sativum roots and bulbs using HPLC-ICPMS/MS-ESI-MS/MS. Species unspecific quantification of acid soluble S-containing metabolites was achieved using HPLC-ICP-MS/MS. For identification of the compounds, high resolution ESI-MS (Orbitrap LTQ and q-TOF) was used. The plants contained up to 54 separated sulphur-containing compounds, which constitute about 80% of the total sulphur present in A. sativum. The roots and bulbs of A. sativum contained the same compounds, but not necessarily the same amounts and proportions. The S-containing metabolites in the roots reacted more sensitively to manipulations of sulphur fertilization than those compounds in the bulbs. In addition to known compounds (e.g. Î³-glutamyl-S-1-propenylcysteine) we were able to identify and partially quantify 31 compounds. Three as yet undescribed S-containing compounds were also identified and quantified for the first time. Putative structures were assigned to the oxidised forms of S-1-propenylmercaptoglutathione, S-2-propenylmercaptoglutathione, S-allyl/propenyl-containing PC-2 and 2-amino-3-[(2-carboxypropyl)sulfanyl]propanoic acid. The parallel use of ICP-MS/MS as a sulphur-specific detector and ESI-MS as a molecular detector simplifies the identification and quantification of sulphur containing metabolites without species specific standards. This non-target analysis approach enables a mass balance approach and identifies the occurrence of the so far unidentified organosulphur compounds. The experiments showed that the sulphur-fertilization regime does not influence sulphur-speciation, but the concentration of some S-containing compounds in roots is dependent on sulphur fertilization.",Sulphur fertilization influences the sulphur species composition in Allium sativum: sulphomics using HPLC-ICPMS/MS-ESI-MS/MS.,"['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Garlic', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']","['methods', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', 'methods']",0.0,garlic,0.10465116279069768,"['Î³-glutamyl-S-1-propenylcysteine', 'S-2-propenylmercaptoglutathione', 'Garlic (A. sativum', 'sulphur-containing', 'S-1-propenylmercaptoglutathione', 'PC-2', 'acid soluble S-containing', '2-amino-3-[(2-carboxypropyl)sulfanyl]propanoic acid', 'q-TOF']",1,9

Results showed that the distribution of these metabolites in the different parts of garlic bulbs was different for the purple and the white ecotypes, with the main difference being a slightly higher number of sulfur compounds in purple garlic. The SS fraction in purple garlic had a higher content of sulfur metabolites, while the ES in white garlic was more enriched by these compounds. The correlation network indicated that diallyl disulfide was the most relevant metabolite with regards to sulfur compound metabolism in garlic.

In addition, antioxidant capacities were evaluated by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging assay. The results showed that garlic had the highest antioxidant capacity, followed by elephant garlic and onion. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between antioxidant activities and organosulphur compounds (RÂ >Â 0.77).

In the present study, we investigated the antihypertensive effects of AGE and its major constituents including S-1-propenylcysteine (S1PC) and S-allylcysteine (SAC) using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and found that S1PC is an active substance to lower blood pressure in SHR. In addition, the metabolomics approach was used to investigate the potential mechanism of the antihypertensive action of S1PC in SHR. Treatment with AGE (2g/kg body weight) or S1PC (6.5mg/kg body weight; equivalent to AGE 2g/kg body weight) significantly decreased the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHR after the repeated administration for 10 weeks, whereas treatment with SAC (7.9mg/kg body weight; equivalent to AGE 2g/kg body weight) did not decrease the SBP. After the treatment for 10 weeks, the plasma samples obtained from Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats and SHR were analyzed by means of ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Multivariate statistical analysis of LC-MS data showed a clear difference in the metabolite profiles between WKY rats and SHR. The results indicated that 30 endogenous metabolites significantly contributed to the difference and 7 of 30 metabolites were changed by the S1PC treatment. Furthermore, regression analysis showed correlation between SBP and the plasma levels of betaine, tryptophan and 3 LysoPCs.

We observed clear morphological changes in apoptotic HSCs and dramatically increased annexin V-positive - propidium iodide negative apoptosis compared with the untreated control group. Twenty-one significant differentially expressed proteins, including 9 downregulated proteins and 12 upregulated proteins, were identified after DATS administration, and most of them were involved in apoptosis.

Accordingly, the aim of this study was to investigate potential garlic-derived metabolites in human urine. To this aim, 14 sets of urine samples were obtained from 12 volunteers, whereby each set comprised one sample that was collected prior to consumption of food-relevant concentrations of garlic, followed by five to eight subsequent samples after garlic consumption that covered a time interval of up to 26 h. The samples were analyzed chemo-analytically using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry (GC-MS/O), as well as sensorially by a trained human panel.

27649517,"Garlic causes a strong garlic breath that may persist for almost a day. Therefore, it is important to study deodorization techniques for garlic breath. The volatiles responsible for garlic breath include diallyl disulfide, allyl mercaptan, allyl methyl disulfide, and allyl methyl sulfide. After eating garlic, water (control), raw, juiced or heated apple, raw or heated lettuce, raw or juiced mint leaves, or green tea were consumed immediately. The levels of the garlic volatiles on the breath were analyzed from 1 to 60 min by selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS). Garlic was also blended with water (control), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), rosemarinic acid, quercetin or catechin, and the volatiles in the headspace analyzed from 3 to 40 min by SIFT-MS. Raw apple, raw lettuce, and mint leaves significantly decreased all of the garlic breath volatiles in vivo. The proposed mechanism is enzymatic deodorization where volatiles react with phenolic compounds. Apple juice and mint juice also had a deodorizing effect on most of the garlic volatiles but were generally not as effective as the raw food, probably because the juice had enzymatic activity but the phenolic compounds had already polymerized. Both heated apple and heated lettuce produced a significant reduction of diallyl disulfide and allyl mercaptan. The presence of phenolic compounds that react with the volatile compounds even in the absence of enzymes is the most likely mechanism. Green tea had no deodorizing effect on the garlic volatile compounds. Rosmarinic acid, catechin, quercetin, and PPO significantly decreased all garlic breath volatiles in vitro.

To analyze and explain these changes, the contents of water-soluble sugars, fructan, and the key intermediate compounds (Heyns and Amadori) of the Maillard reaction in fresh raw garlic and black garlic were investigated, which were important to control and to evaluate the quality of black garlic. The results showed that the fructan contents in the black garlics were decreased by more than 84.6% compared with the fresh raw garlics, which translated into changes in the fructose and glucose contents. The water-soluble sugar content was drastically increased by values ranging from 187.79% to 790.96%. Therefore, the taste of the black garlic became very sweet. The sucrose content in black garlic was almost equivalent to fresh garlic.

It is necessary to explore novel nonthermal techniques for preventing foodborne viral contamination. In this study, aqueous extracts of six raw food materials (flower buds of clove, fenugreek seeds, garlic and onion bulbs, ginger rhizomes, and jalapeÃ±o peppers) were tested for antiviral activity against feline calicivirus (FCV) as a surrogate for human norovirus. The antiviral assay was performed using dilutions of the extracts below the maximum nontoxic concentrations of the extracts to the host cells of FCV, Crandell-Reese feline kidney (CRFK) cells. No antiviral effect was seen when the host cells were pretreated with any of the extracts. However, pretreatment of FCV with nondiluted clove and ginger extracts inactivated 6.0 and 2.7 log of the initial titer of the virus, respectively. Also, significant dosedependent inactivation of FCV was seen when host cells were treated with clove and ginger extracts at the time of infection or postinfection at concentrations equal to or lower than the maximum nontoxic concentrations. By comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, eugenol (29.5%) and R-(-)-1,2-propanediol (10.7%) were identified as the major components of clove and ginger extracts, respectively.

However, the precise mode of action of allicin is unknown. Here, we show that growth inhibition of Escherichia coli during allicin exposure coincides with a depletion of the glutathione pool and S-allylmercapto modification of proteins, resulting in overall decreased total sulfhydryl levels. This is accompanied by the induction of the oxidative and heat stress response. We identified and quantified the allicin-induced modification S-allylmercaptocysteine for a set of cytoplasmic proteins by using a combination of label-free mass spectrometry and differential isotope-coded affinity tag labeling of reduced and oxidized thiol residues. Activity of isocitrate lyase AceA, an S-allylmercapto-modified candidate protein, is largely inhibited by allicin treatment in vivo Allicin-induced protein modifications trigger protein aggregation, which largely stabilizes RpoH and thereby induces the heat stress response. At sublethal concentrations, the heat stress response is crucial to overcome allicin stress.

26964532,"The quality of chicken meat, which is one of the most widely consumed meats in the world, has been the subject of research and studies for many years. There are several ways to improve the quality of this type of meat, including changing the concentrations of individual molecular components. Such important components of meat are inter alia, cholesterol, vitamin E, and some fatty acids such as Ï-3 and Ï-6. Manipulation of ingredient levels may be achieved by enriching chicken feed with elements of different types such as vegetable oils, garlic, or selenium. Thus far, various biochemical and biophysical methods have been used to study quality of different meat types, especially broiler meat. Here, the authors demonstrate the use of high-resolution time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) mass spectrometry to assess how variations in animal nutrition affect concentrations of specific lipids in the meat, such as cholesterol and vitamin E. In the presented experiment, there were four different dietary treatments. Feed for animals in the first group was supplemented with soy oil in 50%, the second group's feed was supplemented with linseed oil in 50%, a combination of these two oils in the proportion of 44%:56% was used for the third group, and in the reference group, animals were fed with beef tallow. From each group, four individuals were selected for further analysis. Positive and negative ion mass spectra were generated from the pectoralis superficialis muscle tissue of the left carcass side of each one animal. Using TOF-SIMS with a bismuth cluster ion source (Bi3 (+)), and based on characteristic peaks for cholesterol in the positive mode and vitamin E in the negative mode, the authors have illustrated the relationship of these lipids levels to the various feeding regimens. Simultaneously, the authors characterized the varying dependences on the concentrations of measured lipids in fat and muscle fibers. The cholesterol concentration in muscle fibers was the lowest in the group fed with soybean oil and the highest in reference group IV (tallow feed). In the fatty region, the highest level of cholesterol was found in the third group. The highest concentrations of vitamin E were found in the fibers of the first group and the fat region of the second group.

With the help of thin layer chromatography technique and computer-assisted image analysis, we performed the quantitative determination of GSAC. The optimum conditions for a biocatalyzed synthesis of GSAC were 200 mM glutamine, 200 mM S-allyl-L-cysteine, 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0), and BlGGT at a final concentration of 1.0 U/mL. After a 15-h incubation of the reaction mixture at 60 Â°C, the GSAC yield for the free and immobilized enzymes was 19.3% and 18.3%, respectively. The enzymatic synthesis of GSAC was repeated under optimal conditions at 1-mmol preparative level. The reaction products together with the commercially available GSAC were further subjected to an ESI-MS/MS analysis.

The strong antioxidant effect of garlic extract (GE) has also recently been claimed to prevent cancer, thrombus formation, cardiovascular disease and some age-related maladies. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism, aqueous GE was herein shown to increase the expression of longevity-related FOXO transcription factor daf-16 and extend lifespan by 20%. By employing microarray and proteomics analysis on C. elegans treated with aqueous GE, we have systematically mapped 229 genes and 46 proteins with differential expression profiles, which included many metabolic enzymes and yolky egg vitellogenins. To investigate the garlic components functionally involved in longevity, an integrated metabolo-proteomics approach was employed to identify metabolites and protein components associated with treatment of aqueous GE. Among potential lifespan-promoting substances, mannose-binding lectin and N-acetylcysteine were found to increase daf-16 expression.

We set out to determine if pure allicin and aqueous garlic extracts (AGE) exhibit antimicrobial properties against the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), the major bacterial phytopathogen for alliums and an intrinsically multiresistant and life-threatening human pathogen. We prepared an AGE from commercial garlic bulbs and used HPLC to quantify the amount of allicin therein using an aqueous allicin standard (AAS). Initially we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the AGE against 38 Bcc isolates; these MICs ranged from 0.5 to 3% (v/v). The antimicrobial activity of pure allicin (AAS) was confirmed by MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) assays against a smaller panel of five Bcc isolates; these included three representative strains of the most clinically important species, B. cenocepacia. Time kill assays, in the presence of ten times MIC, showed that the bactericidal activity of AGE and AAS against B. cenocepacia C6433 correlated with the concentration of allicin. We also used protein mass spectrometry analysis to begin to investigate the possible molecular mechanisms of allicin with a recombinant form of a thiol-dependent peroxiredoxin (BCP, Prx) from B. cenocepacia. This revealed that AAS and AGE modifies an essential BCP catalytic cysteine residue and suggests a role for allicin as a general electrophilic reagent that targets protein thiols. To our knowledge, we report the first evidence that allicin and allicin-containing garlic extracts possess inhibitory and bactericidal activities against the Bcc.

25420111,"Aged garlic extract (AGE) is widely used as a dietary supplement, and is claimed to promote human health through anti-oxidant/anti-inflammatory activities with hypolipidemic, antiplatelet and neuroprotective effects. Prior studies of AGE have mainly focused on its organosulfur compounds, with little attention paid to its carbohydrate derivatives, such as N-Î±-(1-deoxy-D-fructos-1-yl)-L-arginine (FruArg). The goal of this study is to investigate actions of AGE and FruArg on antioxidative and neuroinflammatory responses in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated murine BV-2 microglial cells using a proteomic approach. Our data show that both AGE and FruArg can significantly inhibit LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in BV-2 cells. Quantitative proteomic analysis by combining two dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) with mass spectrometry revealed that expressions of 26 proteins were significantly altered upon LPS exposure, while levels of 20 and 21 proteins exhibited significant changes in response to AGE and FruArg treatments, respectively, in LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells. Notably, approximate 78% of the proteins responding to AGE and FruArg treatments are in common, suggesting that FruArg is a major active component of AGE. MULTICOM-PDCN and Ingenuity Pathway Analyses indicate that the proteins differentially affected by treatment with AGE and FruArg are involved in inflammatory responses and the Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response. Collectively, these results suggest that AGE and FruArg attenuate neuroinflammatory responses and promote resilience in LPS-activated BV-2 cells by suppressing NO production and by regulating expression of multiple protein targets associated with oxidative stress.

Still, many S-containing flavors also possess fruity scents and may be used in compositions of perfumes that require a fresh and fruity odor perception. They are naturally abundant in various fruits, essential oils, and food. Most of these compounds possess strong scents, and their scent composition is highly dependent on the concentration applied. At higher concentrations, they usually feature repellent off-odors, while their sweet and fruity nature is only experienced at very low concentrations. This represents a challenge for their application in perfumery, as well as in food industry.

Closed Oâ electrode measurements revealed that the S. vortens ATCC 50386 strain was more Oâ tolerant than a freshly isolated S. vortens intestinal strain (Sv1). In contrast to the related human diplomonad, Giardia intestinalis, RP-HPLC revealed the major non-protein thiols of S. vortens to be glutathione (GSH, 776 nmol/10â· cells) with cysteine and H2S as minor peaks. Furthermore, antioxidant proteins of S. vortens were assayed enzymatically and revealed that S. vortens possesses superoxide dismutase and NADH oxidase (883 and 37.5nmol/min/mg protein, respectively), but like G. intestinalis, lacks catalase and peroxidase activities.

The treatments were consumed immediately following raw garlic consumption for breath measurements, or were blended with garlic prior to headspace measurements. Measurements were done using a selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometer. Chlorophyllin treatment demonstrated no deodorization in comparison to the control. Successful treatments may be due to enzymatic, polyphenolic, or acid deodorization. Enzymatic deodorization involved oxidation of polyphenolic compounds by enzymes, with the oxidized polyphenols causing deodorization. This was the probable mechanism in raw apple, parsley, spinach, and mint treatments. Polyphenolic deodorization involved deodorization by polyphenolic compounds without enzymatic activity. This probably occurred for microwaved apple, green tea, and lemon juice treatments. When pH is below 3.6, the enzyme alliinase is inactivated, which causes a reduction in volatile formation. This was demonstrated in pH-adjusted headspace measurements. However, the mechanism for volatile reduction on human breath (after volatile formation) is unclear, and may have occurred in soft drink and lemon juice breath treatments.

Thus, the sampling preparation step needs to be implemented before gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. In this work, a simple, non-invasive headspace sampling method for volatile compounds emanating from human skin is presented, using thin film as the extraction phase format. The proposed method was evaluated in terms of reproducibility, membrane size, extraction mode and storage conditions. First, the in vial sampling showed an intra- and inter-membrane RSD% less than 9.8% and 8.2%, respectively, which demonstrated that this home-made skin volatiles sampling device was highly reproducible with regard to intra-, inter-membrane sampling. The in vivo sampling was influenced not only by the skin metabolic status, but also by environmental conditions. The developed sampling set-up (or ""membrane sandwich"") was used to compare two different modes of sampling: headspace and direct sampling. Results demonstrated that headspace sampling had significantly reduced background signal intensity, indicating minimized contamination from the skin surface. In addition, membrane storage conditions both before and after sampling were fully investigated. Membranes stored in dry ice for up to 72 h after collection were tested and showed no or minimal change in volatile profiles. This novel skin volatile compounds sampling approach coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) can achieve reproducible analysis. This technique was applied to identify the biomarkers of garlic intake and alcohol ingestion. Dimethyl sulphone, allyl methyl sulfide and allyl mercaptan, as metabolites of garlic intake, were detected. In addition, alcohol released from skin was also detected using our ""membrane-sandwich"" sampling.

23765168,"Combined pollution of selenium (Se) and mercury (Hg) has been known in Wanshan district (Guizhou Province, China). A better understanding of how Se and Hg interact in plants and the phytotoxicity thereof will provide clues about how to avoid or mitigate adverse effects of Se/Hg on local agriculture. In this study, the biological activity of Se has been investigated in garlic with or without Hg exposure. Se alone can promote garlic growth at low levels (<0.1 mg L(-1)), whereas it inhibits garlic growth at high levels (>1 mg L(-1)). The promotive effect of Se in garlic can be enhanced by low Hg exposure (<0.1 mg L(-1)). When both Se and Hg are at high levels, there is a general antagonistic effect between these two elements in terms of phytotoxicity. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) data suggest that Se is mainly concentrated in garlic roots, compared to the leaves and the bulbs. Se uptake by garlic in low Se medium (<0.1 mg L(-1)) can be significantly enhanced as Hg exposure levels increase (P < 0.05), while it can be inhibited by Hg when Se exposure levels exceed 1 mg L(-1). The synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SRXRF) mapping further shows that Se is mainly concentrated in the stele of the roots, bulbs and the veins of the leaves, and Se accumulation in garlic can be reduced by Hg. The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) study indicates that Se is mainly formed in C-Se-C form in garlic. Hg can decrease the content of inorganic Se mainly in SeO3(2-) form in garlic while increasing the content of organic Se mainly in C-Se-C form (MeSeCys and its derivatives). Hg-mediated changes in Se species along with reduced Se accumulation in garlic may account for the protective effect of Hg against Se phytotoxicity.

The distributions of selenium and mercury were examined with micro-synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (Î¼-SRXRF), and the mercury speciation was investigated with micro-X-ray absorption near edge structure (Î¼-XANES). The results show that Se at higher exposure levels (>1mg/L of SeO3(2-) or SeO4(2-)) would significantly inhibit the absorption and transportation of Hg when Hg(2+) levels are higher than 1mg/L in culture media. SeO3(2-) and SeO4(2-) were found to be equally effective in reducing Hg accumulation in garlic. The inhibition of Hg uptake by Se correlates well with the influence of Se on Hg phytotoxicity as indicated by the growth inhibition factor. Elemental imaging using Î¼-SRXRF also shows that Se could inhibit the accumulation and translocation of Hg in garlic.

Diluted solutions were topically applied to the thorax, which allowed for calculating LD50 and LD90 values associated with 1 d after treatment. A wide range in acute toxicity was observed across all four scarab species. Of the 24 oils tested, allyl isothiocyanate, cinnamon leaf, clove, garlic, and red thyme oils exhibited toxicity to all four species. Allyl isothiocyanate was the most toxic oil tested against the European chafer, and among the most toxic against the Japanese beetle, oriental beetle, and northern masked chafer. Red thyme was also comparatively toxic to the Japanese beetle, oriental beetle, European chafer, and northern masked chafer. Interspecific variability in susceptibility to the essential oils was documented, with 12, 11, 8, and 6 of the 24 essential oils being toxic to the oriental beetle, Japanese beetle, European chafer, and northern masked chafer, respectively.

Engorged B. annulatus females were collected from naturally infected cattle. A number of engorged ticks were incubated at 28Â Â°C and 85Â % relative humidity to lay eggs, which were incubated to obtain larvae that were used in the study. The used garlic and onion oils were prepared by steam distillation and were analyzed by gas chromatography. These oils were dissolved in ethanol, methanol alcohols, and, partially, in water. The oils were tested in different concentrations; 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20Â %. These concentrations were applied on adult ticks by adult immersion test; on larvae by larval immersion technique and on eggs. The 20, 10, and 5Â % of garlic oil dilutions in ethanol and methanol killed all adult ticks and larvae within 24Â h. Similar results were obtained for 10 and 20Â % garlic oil dissolved in water. The effect of 10Â % aqueous solution of garlic oil on embryonated eggs was clear as its addition to these eggs led to their in ability to hatch, deformity in shape, and change in color.

Graphite oxide (GO), with rich oxygen-containing groups, was selected as the starting material to anchor ZnO on its nucleation center. After being deoxidized by hydrazine, the Zn(OH)2/GO coating was dehydrated at high temperature to give the ZnO/graphene coating. Sol-gel technology could efficiently incorporate ZnO/graphene composites into the sol-gel network and provided strong chemical bonding between sol-gel polymeric SPME coating and silica fiber surface, which enhanced the durability of the fiber and allowed more than 200 replicate extractions. Results indicated that pure ZnO coated fiber did not show adsorption selectivity toward sulfur compounds, which might because the ZnO nanoparticles were enwrapped in the sol-gel network, and the strong coordination action between Zn ion and S ion was therefore blocked. The incorporation of graphene into ZnO based sol-gel network greatly enlarged the BET surface area from 1.2 m2/g to 169.4 m2/g and further increased the adsorption sites.

The prepared high polar PSP-TiO(2) hybrid coating avoided the swelling of PSP and cracking of TiO(2) coating by combining the good film-forming property of PSP with the high mechanical strength of TiO(2). The scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that no obvious swelling and damage occurred for the PSP-TiO(2) hybrid stir bar coating after 30 extraction/desorption cycles. The preparation reproducibility of PSP-TiO(2) coated stir bar, evaluated with the relative standard deviations (RSDs), was in the range of 6.7-12.6% (n=5) in one batch, and 9.9-17.6% (n=7) among different batches. The limits of detection (LODs) of the developed method for six target selenium species were in the range of 50.2-185.5 ngL(-1) (as (77)Se) and 45.9-158.8 ngL(-1) (as (82)Se) with the RSDs within 4.9-11.7%. The dynamic linear range was found to cover three orders of magnitude with correlation coefficient of 0.9995-0.9999. The developed method was applied for the analysis of Certified Reference Material SELM-1 selenium enriched yeast and the determined values were in good agreement with the certified values. The method has also been applied for the analysis of seleno-amino acids and seleno-oligopeptides in human urine and garlic samples. Different from the conventional organic polymer SBSE coatings (such as polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS), the extraction mechanism of PSP-TiO(2) organic-inorganic hybrid SBSE coating was based on the cation exchange interaction, which made it feasible to directly extract high polar seleno-amino acids and seleno-oligopeptides in biological samples without derivatization.

22860996,"Garlic has been used throughout history for both culinary and medicinal purpose. Allicin is a major component of crushed garlic. Although it is sensitive to heat and light and easily metabolized into various compounds such as diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, and diallyl sulfide, allicin is still a major bioactive compound of crushed garlic. The mortality of hepatocellular carcinoma is quite high and ranks among the top 10 cancer-related deaths in Taiwan. Although numerous studies have shown the cancer-preventive properties of garlic and its components, there is no study on the effect of allicin on the growth of human liver cancer cells. In this study, we focused on allicin-induced autophagic cell death in human liver cancer Hep G2 cells. Our results indicated that allicin induced p53-mediated autophagy and inhibited the viability of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Using Western blotting, we observed that allicin decreased the level of cytoplasmic p53, the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway, and the level of Bcl-2 and increased the expression of AMPK/TSC2 and Beclin-1 signaling pathways in Hep G2 cells. In addition, the colocalization of LC3-II with MitoTracker-Red (labeling mitochondria), resulting in allicin-induced degradation of mitochondria, could be observed by confocal laser microscopy.

22500289,"The molecular characteristics of chlorothalonil can cause particular determination difficulties in some vegetable commodities such as leek or garlic. These difficulties are mainly related to the low recoveries obtained using common multi-residue methods (MRMs)--a consequence of the very high interaction level with natural components in the matrix. These shortcomings were pointed out in the last European Proficiency Test for Pesticide Residues on Fruits and Vegetables, where false negatives for chlorothalonil in leek were observed at around 50%. In this study we have evaluated the ethyl acetate, the Dutch mini-Luke and the QuEChERS MRMs to compare their capabilities for chlorothalonil determination using GC-MS/MS in both the electron impact ionization (EI) and negative chemical ionization (NCI) modes. Best recoveries (in the range of 100-120%, with an RSD below 20%) were obtained using the Dutch mini-Luke method. Lower values (52-70%) were obtained for ethyl acetate whereas no recovery was obtained when the QuEChERS method was applied. Furthermore, tomato matrix was also included in the experiments in order to facilitate the comparability of results. Two ionization modes, electron impact ionization (EI) and negative chemical ionization (NCI) in GC-MS/MS, were applied to evaluate their respective advantages and disadvantages for quantification and identification.

22473818,"Sulfenic acids play a prominent role in biology as key participants in cellular signaling relating to redox homeostasis, in the formation of protein-disulfide linkages, and as the central players in the fascinating organosulfur chemistry of the Allium species (e.g., garlic). Despite their relevance, direct measurements of their reaction kinetics have proven difficult owing to their high reactivity. Herein, we describe the results of hydrocarbon autoxidations inhibited by the persistent 9-triptycenesulfenic acid, which yields a second order rate constant of 3.0Ã10(6) âM(-1) âs(-1) for its reaction with peroxyl radicals in PhCl at 30âÂ°C. This rate constant drops 19-fold in CH(3)CN, and is subject to a significant primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect, k(H)/k(D) = 6.1, supporting a formal H-atom transfer (HAT) mechanism. Analogous autoxidations inhibited by the Allium-derived (S)-benzyl phenylmethanethiosulfinate and a corresponding deuterium-labeled derivative unequivocally demonstrate the role of sulfenic acids in the radical-trapping antioxidant activity of thiosulfinates, through the rate-determining Cope elimination of phenylmethanesulfenic acid (k(H)/k(D) â 4.5) and its subsequent formal HAT reaction with peroxyl radicals (k(H)/k(D) â 3.5). The rate constant that we derived from these experiments for the reaction of phenylmethanesulfenic acid with peroxyl radicals was 2.8Ã10(7) âM(-1) âs(-1); a value 10-fold larger than that we measured for the reaction of 9-triptycenesulfenic acid with peroxyl radicals. We propose that whereas phenylmethanesulfenic acid can adopt the optimal syn geometry for a 5-centre proton-coupled electron-transfer reaction with a peroxyl radical, the 9-triptycenesulfenic is too sterically hindered, and undergoes the reaction instead through the less-energetically favorable anti geometry, which is reminiscent of a conventional HAT.",The reaction of sulfenic acids with peroxyl radicals: insights into the radical-trapping antioxidant activity of plant-derived thiosulfinates.,"['Antioxidants', 'Garlic', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peroxides', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Sulfenic Acids', 'Sulfinic Acids']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemical synthesis']",,garlic,0.14705882352941177,"['deuterium', 'protein-disulfide', 'thiosulfinates', 'acids', 'peroxyl']",1,10
22467307,"Diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a polysulfide constituent found in garlic oil, is capable of the release of hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S). H(2)S is a known cardioprotective agent that protects the heart via antioxidant, antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and mitochondrial actions. Here, we investigated DATS as a stable donor of H(2)S during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury in vivo. We investigated endogenous H(2)S levels, infarct size, postischemic left ventricular function, mitochondrial respiration and coupling, endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) activation, and nuclear E2-related factor (Nrf2) translocation after DATS treatment. Mice were anesthetized and subjected to a surgical model of MI/R injury with and without DATS treatment (200 Î¼g/kg). Both circulating and myocardial H(2)S levels were determined using chemiluminescent gas chromatography. Infarct size was measured after 45 min of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. Troponin I release was measured at 2, 4, and 24 h after reperfusion. Cardiac function was measured at baseline and 72 h after reperfusion by echocardiography. Cardiac mitochondria were isolated after MI/R, and mitochondrial respiration was investigated. NO metabolites, eNOS phosphorylation, and Nrf2 translocation were determined 30 min and 2 h after DATS administration. Myocardial H(2)S levels markedly decreased after I/R injury but were rescued by DATS treatment (P < 0.05). DATS administration significantly reduced infarct size per area at risk and per left ventricular area compared with control (P < 0.001) as well as circulating troponin I levels at 4 and 24 h (P < 0.05). Myocardial contractile function was significantly better in DATS-treated hearts compared with vehicle treatment (P < 0.05) 72 h after reperfusion. DATS reduced mitochondrial respiration in a concentration-dependent manner and significantly improved mitochondrial coupling after reperfusion (P < 0.01). DATS activated eNOS (P < 0.05) and increased NO metabolites (P < 0.05). DATS did not appear to significantly induce the Nrf2 pathway.

22284504,"In recent years, the release of information about the preventative and curative properties of garlic on different diseases and their benefits to human health has led to an increase in the consumption of garlic. To meet the requirements of international markets and reach competitiveness and profitability, farmers seek to extend the offer period of fresh garlic by increasing post-harvest life. As a result, the use of maleic hydrazide (1,2-dihydropyridazine-3,6-dione) [MH], a plant growth regulator, has been widespread in various garlic growing regions of the world. The present work was undertaken to develop and validate a new analytical procedure based on MH extraction from garlic previously frozen by liquid nitrogen and submitted to low temperature clean-up. The applicability of the method by analysis of garlic samples from a commercial plantation was also demonstrated. The influence of certain factors on the performance of the analytical methodology were studied and optimized. The approach is an efficient extraction, clean-up and determination alternative for MH residue-quantification due to its specificity and sensitivity. The use of liquid nitrogen during the sample preparation prevents the degradation of the analyte due to oxidation reactions, a major limiting factor. Moreover, the method provides good linearity (r(2): 0.999), good intermediate precision (coefficient of variation (CV): 8.39%), and extracts were not affected by the matrix effect. Under optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) (0.33 mg kg(-1)) was well below the maximum residue level (MRL) set internationally for garlic (15 mg kg(-1)), with excellent rates of recovery (over 95%), good repeatability and acceptable accuracy (CV averaged 5.74%), since garlic is a complex matrix. The analytical performance of the methodology presented was compared with other techniques already reported, with highly satisfactory results, lower LOD and higher recoveries rates. In addition, the extraction process is simple, not expensive, easily executable and requires lower volumes of organic solvent. The proposed methodology removes the need of extensive typical laboratory extraction procedures, reducing the amount of time needed for pesticide analysis and increasing sample throughput.

22097791,"A new idea of solvent transfer technique was developed and applied to determine 283 pesticide residues in garlic by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (method I), and the other method using normal phase silica/selective elution technique was applied to determine 6 pesticide residues with strongly polar in garlic by gas chromatography (method II). For the method I, the residues were extracted from homogenized tissue with acetonitrile-water, separated with liquid-liquid partition; the clear supernatant was purified by solvent transfer technique and solid phase extraction (Envi-18 and LC-NH2 columns), then was analyzed by GC-MS. For the method II, the residues were extracted from homogenized tissue using ethyl acetate and sodium sulfate assisted by ultrasonication. The supernatant was purified by solid phase extraction (primary secondary amine (PSA) powder and LC-Si column) prior to GC analysis. The determination was performed by using selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode in GC-MS method and flame photometric detector (FPD) in GC method, then external standard method was used in the quantification. Under the optimal conditions, the detection limits for the two methods (S/N > or = 10) of pesticides were 0.01-0.05 mg/kg, the recoveries carried out by the addition of standards of 0.01-0.20 mg/kg were 52%-163%, among which the recoveries for 88% pesticides were between 70% and 120%; the recoveries of the method II were 70%-111%; while the relative standard deviations were 2.4%-18% and 3.2%-9.3%, respectively.

The unknown pink-red pigments were generated and separated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and a diode array detector (DAD) in the range of 200 to 700 nm. To generate pink-red pigments, we developed several reaction systems using garlic alliinase, purified 1-propenyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide (1-PeCSO), onion thiosulfinate, natural onion juice, and 21 free amino acids. The compound 1-PeCSO was a key compound associated with pinking in the presence of both the alliinase and amino acids. Numerous naturally occurring pink-red pigments were detected and separated from pink onion juice using the HPLC-DAD system at 515 nm. Most free amino acids, with the exceptions of histidine, serine, and cysteine, formed various pink-red pigments when reacted with onion thiosulfinate. This observation indicated that onion pinking is caused not by a single pigment, but by many. Furthermore, more than one color compound could be produced from a single amino acid; this explains, in part, why there were many pink-red compound peaks in the chromatogram of discolored natural onion juice. We presumed that the complexity of the pink-red pigments was due to the involvement of more than 21 natural amino acids as well as several derivatives of the color products produced from each amino acid.

20730643,"A rapid, simple and sensitive multi-residue method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification and confirmation of 69 pesticides in fruit and vegetables using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The samples were extracted following the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe method known as QuEChERS. Mass spectrometric conditions were individually optimised for each analyte in order to achieve maximum sensitivity in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Using the developed chromatographic conditions, 69 pesticides can be separated in less than 17 min. Two selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays were used for each pesticide to obtain simultaneous quantification and identification in one run. With this method in SRM mode, more than 150 pesticides can be analysed and quantified, but their confirmation is not possible in all cases according to the European regulations on pesticide residues. Nine common representative matrices (zucchini, melon, cucumber, watermelon, tomato, garlic, eggplant, lettuce and pepper) were selected to investigate the effect of different matrices on recovery and precision. Mean recoveries ranged from 70% to 120%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 20% for all the pesticides. The proposed method was applied to the analysis of more than 2000 vegetable samples from the extensive greenhouse cultivation in the province of Almeria, Spain, during one year. The methodology combines the advantages of both QuEChERS and LC-MS/MS producing a very rapid, sensitive, accurate and reliable procedure that can be applied in routine analytical laboratories.

Milk was more effective than water and 10% sodium caseinate in the deodorization of allyl methyl sulfide, a persistent garlic odor, in the mouth after garlic ingestion. Addition of milk to garlic before ingestion had a higher deodorizing effect on the volatiles in the mouth than drinking milk after consuming garlic.

D. citri generally rely on olfaction and vision for detection of host cues. Plant volatiles from Allium spp. (Alliaceae) are known to repel several arthropod species. We examined the effect of garlic chive (A. tuberosum Rottl.) and wild onion (A. canadense L.) volatiles on D. citri behaviour in a two-port divided T-olfactometer. Citrus leaf volatiles attracted significantly more D. citri adults than clean air. Volatiles from crushed garlic chive leaves, garlic chive essential oil, garlic chive plants, wild onion plants and crushed wild onion leaves all repelled D. citri adults when compared with clean air, with the first two being significantly more repellent than the others. However, when tested with citrus volatiles, only crushed garlic chive leaves and garlic chive essential oil were repellent, and crushed wild onions leaves were not. Analysis of the headspace components of crushed garlic chive leaves and garlic chive essential oil by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that monosulfides, disulfides and trisulfides were the primary sulfur volatiles present. In general, trisulfides (dimethyl trisulfide) inhibited the response of D. citri to citrus volatiles more than disulfides (dimethyl disulfide, allyl methyl disulfide, allyl disulfide). Monosulfides did not affect the behaviour of D. citri adults. A blend of dimethyl trisulfide and dimethyl disulfide in 1:1 ratio showed an additive effect on inhibition of D. citri response to citrus volatiles. The plant volatiles from Allium spp. did not affect the behaviour of the D. citri ecto-parasitoid Tamarixia radiata (Waterston).

The vasoactivity was proposed to occur via glucose- and thiol-dependent acellular reactions. In the present study, we investigated the interaction of garlic extracts with human deoxygenated RBCs and its effect on intracellular hemoglobin molecules. The results showed that garlic extract covalently modified intraerythrocytic deoxygenated hemoglobin. The modification identified consisted of an addition of 71 atomic mass units, suggesting allylation of the cysteine residues. Consistently, purified human deoxyhemoglobin reacted with chemically pure diallyl disulfide, showing the same modification as garlic extracts. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that garlic extract and diallyl disulfide modified hemoglobin's beta-chain at cysteine-93 (beta-93C) or cysteine-112 (beta-112C). These results indicate that garlic-derived organic disulfides as well as pure diallyl disulfide must permeate the RBC membrane and modified deoxyhemoglobin at beta-93C or beta-112C.

The soluble fusion protein could be purified by immobilized metal affinity column (IMAC), followed by size exclusion chromatography. The SUMO protease failed to cleave the SUMO peptide from ASAL. This may be due to steric hindrance caused by the homodimer structure of the chimeric ASAL. Some properties like dimerization, haemagglutination and insecticidal properties of the recombinant SUMO-ASAL fusion protein were comparable to the plant derived native lectin. However, glycan array analysis revealed that the carbohydrate binding specificity of the recombinant SUMO-ASAL was altered. Further, the fusion protein was not toxic to E. coli (native ASAL exhibited toxicity). The recombinant lectin was more thermo-labile as compared to the native lectin.

Dietary garlic and onion have been recently observed to possess anti-lithogenic potential in experimental mice. In this investigation, the role of biliary proteins from rats fed lithogenic diet or garlic/onion-containing diet in the formation of cholesterol gallstones in model bile was studied. Cholesterol nucleation time of the bile from lithogenic diet group was prolonged when mixed with bile from garlic or onion groups. High molecular weight proteins of bile from garlic and onion groups delayed cholesterol crystal growth in model bile. Low molecular weight (LMW) proteins from the bile of lithogenic diet group promoted cholesterol crystal growth in model bile, while LMW protein fraction isolated from the bile of garlic and onion groups delayed the same. Biliary LMW protein fraction was subjected to affinity chromatography using Con-A and the lectin-bound and unbound fractions were studied for their influence on cholesterol nucleation time in model bile. Major portion of biliary LMW proteins in lithogenic diet group was bound to Con-A, and this protein fraction promoted cholesterol nucleation time and increased cholesterol crystal growth rate, whereas Con-A unbound fraction delayed the onset of cholesterol crystallization. Biliary protein from garlic/onion group delayed the crystallization and interfered with pronucleating activity of Con-A bound protein fraction.

19734685,"Allicin (allyl 2-propenethiosulfinate), an antibacterial principle of garlic, has drawn much attention, since it has potent antimicrobial activity against a range of microorganisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. There have been many reports on the antibacterial properties of allicin, but no quantitative comparison of antibacterial activities between freshly prepared garlic extract and clinically useful antibiotics has been performed. To verify the substantial antibacterial effect of aqueous garlic extract, we compared it with those of allicin and several clinically useful antibiotics using two representative bacteria commonly found in the human environment, Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli. The garlic extract had more potent anti-staphylococcal activity than an equal amount of allicin. In terms of antibiotic potency against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, authentic allicin had roughly 1-2% of the potency of streptomycin (vs. S. aureus), 8% of that of vancomycin (vs. S. aureus), and only 0.2% of that of colistin (vs. E. coli). The antibacterial activity of allicin was completely abolished by cysteine, glutathione and coenzyme A, but not by non-SH-compounds.

19733738,"Liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry--LC/ESI/MS--a primary tool for analysis of low volatility compounds in difficult matrices--suffers from the matrix effects in the ESI ionization. It is well known that matrix effects can be reduced by sample dilution. However, the efficiency of simple sample dilution is often limited, in particular by the limit of detection of the method, and can strongly vary from sample to sample. In this study matrix effect is investigated as the function of dilution. It is demonstrated that in some cases dilution can eliminate matrix effect, but often it is just reduced. Based on these findings we propose a new quantitation method based on consecutive dilutions of the sample and extrapolation of the analyte content to the infinite dilution, i.e. to matrix-free solution. The method was validated for LC/ESI/MS analysis of five pesticides (methomyl, thiabendazole, aldicarb, imazalil, methiocarb) in five matrices (tomato, cucumber, apple, rye and garlic) at two concentration levels (0.5 and 5.0 mg kg(-1)). Agreement between the analyzed and spiked concentrations was found for all samples. It was demonstrated that in terms of accuracy of the obtained results the proposed extrapolative dilution approach works distinctly better than simple sample dilution. The main use of this approach is envisaged for (a) method development/validation to determine the extent of matrix effects and the ways of overcoming them and (b) as a second step of analysis in the case of samples having analyte contents near the maximum residue limits (MRL).",Combating matrix effects in LC/ESI/MS: the extrapolative dilution approach.,[],[],0.0,garlic,0.06578947368421052,"['thiabendazole', 'aldicarb', 'methomyl', 'imazalil, methiocarb', 'analyte']",1,5
19733357,"A novel HPLC method for determination of a wide variety of S-substituted cysteine derivatives in Allium species has been developed and validated. This method allows simultaneous separation and quantification of S-alk(en)ylcysteine S-oxides, gamma-glutamyl-S-alk(en)ylcysteines and gamma-glutamyl-S-alk(en)ylcysteine S-oxides in a single run. The procedure is based on extraction of these amino acids and dipeptides by methanol, their derivatization by dansyl chloride and subsequent separation by reversed phase HPLC. The main advantages of the new method are simplicity, excellent stability of derivatives, high sensitivity, specificity and the ability to simultaneously analyze the whole range of S-substituted cysteine derivatives. This method was critically compared with other chromatographic procedures used for quantification of S-substituted cysteine derivatives, namely with two other HPLC methods (derivatization by o-phthaldialdehyde/tert-butylthiol and fluorenylmethyl chloroformate), and with determination by gas chromatography or capillary electrophoresis. Major advantages and drawbacks of these analytical procedures are discussed.

Optimization of the simultaneous extraction of these toxins and the sample pretreatment procedure, as well as method validation were performed on maca (Lepidium meyenii) food supplements. The results indicated that the solvent mixture ethyl acetate/formic acid (95:5, v/v) was the best compromise for the extraction of the analytes from food supplements. Liquid-liquid partition with n-hexane was applied as partial clean-up step to remove excess of co-extracted non-polar components. Further clean-up was performed on Oasis HLB cartridges. Samples were analysed using an Acquity UPLC system coupled to a Micromass Quattro Micro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray interface operated in the positive-ion mode. Limits of detection and quantification were in the range of 0.3-30 ng g(-1) and 1-100 ng g(-1), respectively. Recovery yields were above 60% for most of the analytes, except for nivalenol, sterigmatocystine and the fumonisins. The method showed good precision and trueness.

N-Nitrosoproline (NPRO) excretion has been used as an index for endogenous nitrosation. In vitro and animal studies have reported that compounds in garlic may suppress nitrosation and inhibit carcinogenesis. We present a new method for extraction and sensitive detection of both NPRO and N-acetyl-S-allylcysteine from urine. The latter is a metabolite of S-allylcysteine, which is found in garlic. Urine was acidified and the organic acids were extracted by reversed-phase extraction (RP-SPE) and use of a polymeric weak anion exchange (WAX-SPE) resin. NPRO was quantified by isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using [13C5]NPRO and N-nitrosopipecolinic acid (NPIC) as internal standards. This method was used to analyze urine samples from a study that was designed to test whether garlic supplementation inhibits NPRO synthesis. Using this method, 2.4 to 46.0 ng NPRO/ml urine was detected. The method is straightforward and reliable, and it can be performed with readily available GC-MS instruments. N-Acetyl-S-allylcysteine was quantified in the same fraction and detectable at levels of 4.1 to 176.4 ng/ml urine. The results suggest that 3 to 5 g of garlic supplements inhibited NPRO synthesis to an extent similar to a 0.5-g dose of ascorbic acid or a commercial supplement of aged garlic extract.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro anti-leishmanial activity of various extracts from ten traditionally used Indian medicinal plants. The methanolic extract from only two plants, Withania somnifera Dunal (ashwagandha) and Allium sativum Linn. (garlic), showed appreciable activity against Leishmania donovani. Further active compounds from these two plants were isolated and purified based on bioactivity-guided fractionation.

19550292,"Garlic is generally used as a therapeutic reagent against various diseases, and numerous studies have indicated that garlic and its derivatives can reduce the risk of various types of human cancer. Diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a major member of garlic derivatives, could inhibit the cell proliferation by triggering either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines as shown in many studies. However, whether DATS has the same effect on human osteosarcoma cells remains unknown. In this study, we have attempted to analyze the effects of DATS on cell proliferation, cell cycle, induction of apoptosis, global protein expression pattern in a human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2 cells, and the potential molecular mechanisms of the action of DATS. Saos-2 cells, a human osteosarcoma cell line, were treated with or without 25, 50, and 100 micromol/l DATS for various time intervals. The cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis were examined in this study. Then, after treatment with or without 50 micromol/l DATS for 48 h, protein add pattern in Saos-2 cells were systematically studied using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. DATS could inhibit the proliferation of Saos-2 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Moreover, the percentage of apoptotic cell and cell arrest in G0/G1 phase was also dose-dependent and time-dependent upon DATS treatment. A total of 27 unique proteins in Saos-2 cells, including 18 downregulated proteins and nine upregulated proteins, were detected with significant changes in their expression levels corresponding to DATS administration. Interestingly, almost half of these proteins (13 of 27) are related to either the cell cycle or apoptosis. DATS has the ability to suppress cell proliferation of Saos-2 cells by blocking cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis in a dose and time-dependent manner. The proteomic results presented, therefore, provide additional support to the hypothesis that DATS is a strong inducer of apoptosis in tumor cells.

19053859,"Garlic (Allium sativum) is regarded as both a food and a medicinal herb. Increasing attention has focused on the biological functions and health benefits of garlic as a potentially major dietary component. Chronic garlic administration has been shown to enhance memory function. Evidence also shows that garlic administration in rats affects brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) levels. 5-HT, a neurotransmitter involved in a number of physiological functions, is also known to enhance cognitive performance. The present study was designed to investigate the probable neurochemical mechanism responsible for the enhancement of memory following garlic administration. Sixteen adult locally bred male albino Wistar rats were divided into control (n = 8) and test (n = 8) groups. The test group was orally administered 250 mg/kg fresh garlic homogenate (FGH), while control animals received an equal amount of water daily for 21 days. Estimation of plasma free and total tryptophan (TRP) and whole brain TRP, 5-HT, and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. For assessment of memory, a step-through passive avoidance paradigm (electric shock avoidance) was used. The results showed that the levels of plasma free TRP significantly increased (P < .01) and plasma total TRP significantly decreased (P < .01) in garlic-treated rats. Brain TRP, 5-HT, and 5-HIAA levels were also significantly increased following garlic administration. A significant improvement in memory function was exhibited by garlic-treated rats in the passive avoidance test. Increased brain 5-HT levels were associated with improved cognitive performance. The present results, therefore, demonstrate that the memory-enhancing effect of garlic may be associated with increased brain 5-HT metabolism in rats.

18624452,"Potentially toxic acrylamide is largely derived from heat-induced reactions between the amino group of the free amino acid asparagine and carbonyl groups of glucose and fructose in cereals, potatoes, and other plant-derived foods. This overview surveys and consolidates the following dietary aspects of acrylamide: distribution in food originating from different sources; consumption by diverse populations; reduction of the acrylamide content in the diet; and suppression of adverse effects in vivo. Methods to reduce adverse effects of dietary acrylamide include (a) selecting potato, cereal, and other plant varieties for dietary use that contain low levels of the acrylamide precursors, namely, asparagine and glucose; (b) removing precursors before processing; (c) using the enzyme asparaginase to hydrolyze asparagine to aspartic acid; (d) selecting processing conditions (pH, temperature, time, processing and storage atmosphere) that minimize acrylamide formation; (e) adding food ingredients (acidulants, amino acids, antioxidants, nonreducing carbohydrates, chitosan, garlic compounds, protein hydrolysates, proteins, metal salts) that have been reported to prevent acrylamide formation; (f) removing/trapping acrylamide after it is formed with the aid of chromatography, evaporation, polymerization, or reaction with other food ingredients; and (g) reducing in vivo toxicity. Research needs are suggested that may further facilitate reducing the acrylamide burden of the diet. Researchers are challenged to (a) apply the available methods and to minimize the acrylamide content of the diet without adversely affecting the nutritional quality, safety, and sensory attributes, including color and flavor, while maintaining consumer acceptance; and (b) educate commercial and home food processors and the public about available approaches to mitigating undesirable effects of dietary acrylamide.",Review of methods for the reduction of dietary content and toxicity of acrylamide.,"['Acrylamide', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asparaginase', 'Asparagine', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diet', 'Edible Grain', 'Female', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Handling', 'Glucose', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Solanum tuberosum']","['administration & dosage', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'methods', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry']",0.0,garlic,0.21875,"['fructose', 'carbonyl', 'asparagine', 'carbohydrates', 'glucose', 'amino acids', 'amino acid asparagine', 'acrylamide', 'aspartic acid']",1,21

The molecular mechanism of action of sodium 2-propenyl thiosulfate has not been completely clarified. In this work we investigated, by in vivo and in vitro experiments, the effects of this compound on the expression and activity of rhodanese. Rhodanese is a protein belonging to a family of enzymes widely present in all phyla and reputed to play a number of distinct biological roles, such as cyanide detoxification, regeneration of iron-sulfur clusters and metabolism of sulfur sulfane compounds. The cytotoxic effects of sodium 2-propenyl thiosulfate on HuT 78 cells were evaluated by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation and by monitoring the progressive formation of mobile lipids by NMR spectroscopy. Sodium 2-propenyl thiosulfate was also found to induce inhibition of the sulfurtransferase activity in tumor cells. Interestingly, in vitro experiments using fluorescence spectroscopy, kinetic studies and MS analysis showed that sodium 2-propenyl thiosulfate was able to bind the sulfur-free form of the rhodanese, inhibiting its thiosulfate:cyanide-sulfurtransferase activity by thiolation of the catalytic cysteine. The activity of the enzyme was restored by thioredoxin in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner.

The (77)Se-enriched gamma-glutamyl-SeMC spike was produced in-house by collecting the fraction at the retention time of the gamma-glutamyl-SeMC peak from a chromatographed aqueous extract of (77)Se-enriched yeast, pooling the collected fractions and freeze-drying the homogenate. The Se content of this spike was characterised using reverse isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) and the isotopic composition of this spike was checked prior to quantification of the natural abundance dipeptide species in garlic using speciated IDA. The extraction of the gamma-glutamyl-SeMC species in water was performed in a sonication bath for 2 h after adding an appropriate quantity of (77)Se-enriched gamma-glutamyl-SeMC to 50 mg of garlic to give optimal (78)Se/(77)Se and (82)Se/(77)Se ratios of 1.5 and 0.6, respectively. The effect of ultrasonic nebulisation, in comparison with the loading of the ICP with carbon (through the addition of methane gas on-line), on the detection of Se associated with gamma-glutamyl-SeMC using collision/reaction cell ICP-MS with hydrogen as collision gas was investigated.

17951430,"The consumption of garlic is inversely correlated with the progression of cardiovascular disease, although the responsible mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that human RBCs convert garlic-derived organic polysulfides into hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), an endogenous cardioprotective vascular cell signaling molecule. This H(2)S production, measured in real time by a novel polarographic H(2)S sensor, is supported by glucose-maintained cytosolic glutathione levels and is to a large extent reliant on reduced thiols in or on the RBC membrane. H(2)S production from organic polysulfides is facilitated by allyl substituents and by increasing numbers of tethering sulfur atoms. Allyl-substituted polysulfides undergo nucleophilic substitution at the alpha carbon of the allyl substituent, thereby forming a hydropolysulfide (RS(n)H), a key intermediate during the formation of H(2)S. Organic polysulfides (R-S(n)-R'; n > 2) also undergo nucleophilic substitution at a sulfur atom, yielding RS(n)H and H(2)S. Intact aorta rings, under physiologically relevant oxygen levels, also metabolize garlic-derived organic polysulfides to liberate H(2)S. The vasoactivity of garlic compounds is synchronous with H(2)S production, and their potency to mediate relaxation increases with H(2)S yield, strongly supporting our hypothesis that H(2)S mediates the vasoactivity of garlic.

The method comprises the preconcentration of Pb (II) ions at a buffered solution (pH 4.7) onto 30mg of MWCNTs previously oxidized with concentrated HNO(3). The elution step is carried out with 1.0molL(-1) HNO(3). The effect of the experimental parameters, including sample pH, sampling flow rate, buffer and eluent concentrations were investigated by means of a 2(4) full factorial design, while for the final optimization a Doehlert design was employed. Under the best experimental conditions the preconcentration system provided detection and quantification limits of 2.6 and 8.6mugL(-1), respectively. A wide linear range varying from 8.6 up to 775mugL(-1) (r>0.999) and the respective precision (relative standard deviation) of 7.7 and 1.4% for the 15 and 200mugL(-1) levels were obtained.

After reduction of Se(VI) by heating the samples in the microwave oven with 4moll(-1) HCl, the system was applied to the total selenium. Se(VI) was calculated as the difference between the total selenium content and Se(IV) content. The experimental parameters, pH, amounts of reagents, eluent type and sample volume were optimized.

Cress belongs to the botanical order Brassicales and produces glucosinolates, which are important precursors of nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds. Those compounds often present low perception thresholds and various olfactive notes and are thus of interest to the flavor and fragrance chemistry. When the study of organonitrogen and organosulfur compounds is undertaken, Brassicale extracts are one of the matrices of choice. Cress extracts were studied by analytical (GC-MS, GC-FPD) and chemical (fractionation) means to identify new interesting odorant compounds. Two compounds that have never been reported in cress extracts, containing both nitrogen and sulfur, were discovered: N-benzyl O-ethyl thiocarbamate and N-phenethyl O-ethyl thiocarbamate. These two molecules being of organoleptic interest, their homologues were synthesized and submitted to organoleptic tests (static and GC-sniffing). Their odors evolve from garlic and onion over green, mushroom- and cress-like to fresh, spearmint-like.

17177506,"Cycloalliin, an organosulfur compound found in garlic and onion, has been reported to exert several biological activities and also to remain stable during storage and processing. In this study, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of cycloalliin in rats after intravenous or oral administration. Cycloalliin and its metabolite, (3R,5S)-5-methyl-1,4-thiazane-3-carboxylic acid, in plasma, urine, feces, and organs was determined by a validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. When administered intravenously at 50 mg/kg, cycloalliin was rapidly eliminated from blood and excreted into urine, and its total recovery in urine was 97.8% +/- 1.3% in 48 h. After oral administration, cycloalliin appeared rapidly in plasma, with a tmax of 0.47 +/- 0.03 h at 25 mg/kg and 0.67 +/- 0.14 h at 50 mg/kg. Orally administered cycloalliin was distributed in heart, lung, liver, spleen, and especially kidney. The Cmax and AUC0-inf values of cycloalliin at 50 mg/kg were approximately 5 times those at 25 mg/kg. When administered orally at 50 mg/kg, cycloalliin was excreted into urine (17.6% +/- 4.2%) but not feces. However, the total fecal excretion of (3R,5S)-5-methyl-1,4-thiazane-3-carboxylic acid was 67.3% +/- 5.9% (value corrected for cycloalliin equivalents). In addition, no (3R,5S)-5-methyl-1,4-thiazane-3-carboxylic acid was detected in plasma (<0.1 microg/mL), and negligible amounts (1.0% +/- 0.3%) were excreted into urine. In in vitro experiments, cycloalliin was reduced to (3R,5S)-5-methyl-1,4-thiazane-3-carboxylic acid during anaerobic incubation with cecal contents of rats. These data indicated that the low bioavailability (3.73% and 9.65% at 25 and 50 mg/kg, respectively) of cycloalliin was due mainly to reduction to (3R,5S)-5-methyl-1,4-thiazane-3-carboxylic acid by the intestinal flora and also poor absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract.

16770577,"The scope of the work was to investigate the influence of selenate fertilisation and the addition of symbiotic fungi (mycorrhiza) to soil on selenium and selenium species concentrations in garlic. The selenium species were extracted from garlic cultivated in experimental plots by proteolytic enzymes, which ensured liberation of selenium species contained in peptides or proteins. Separate extractions using an aqueous solution of enzyme-deactivating hydroxylamine hydrochloride counteracted the possible degradation of labile selenium species by enzymes (such as alliinase) that occur naturally in garlic. The selenium content in garlic, which was analysed by ICP-MS, showed that addition of mycorrhiza to the natural soil increased the selenium uptake by garlic tenfold to 15 microg g(-1) (dry mass). Fertilisation with selenate and addition of mycorrhiza strongly increased the selenium content in garlic to around one part per thousand. The parallel analysis of the sample extracts by cation exchange and reversed-phase HPLC with ICP-MS detection showed that gamma-glutamyl-Se-methyl-selenocysteine amounted to 2/3, whereas methylselenocysteine, selenomethionine and selenate each amounted to a few percent of the total chromatographed selenium in all garlic samples. Se-allyl-selenocysteine and Se-propyl-selenocysteine, which are selenium analogues of biologically active sulfur-containing amino acids known to occur in garlic, were searched for but not detected in any of the extracts. The amendment of soil by mycorrhiza and/or by selenate increased the content of selenium but not the distribution of detected selenium species in garlic.

The production of high-Se garlic requires Se-fertilized soil, but such soil may pollute the environment. Hydroponics is a closed system that allows good control over Se fertilization without environmental consequences. We examined the effect of hydroponic cultivation on Se uptake and assimilation in garlic seedlings. Garlic bulbs were grown in the nutrient solution without Se for first 2 wk, and with potassium selenate for an additional week. Sulfate in an ordinary hydroponic solution inhibited the absorption and assimilation of selenate, but when a sulfate-free nutrient was used for Se addition, the garlic seedlings accumulated >1 mg Se, dry weight.

16484558,"Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that garlic ingestion lowers blood cholesterol levels, and treatment of cells in culture with garlic and garlic-derived compounds inhibits cholesterol synthesis. To identify the principal site of inhibition in the cholesterolgenic pathway and the active components of garlic, cultured hepatoma cells were treated with aqueous garlic extract or its chemical derivatives, and radiolabeled cholesterol and intermediates were identified and quantified. Garlic extract reduced cholesterol synthesis by up to 75% without evidence of cellular toxicity. Levels of squalene and 2,3-oxidosqualene were not altered by garlic, indicating that the site of inhibition was downstream of lanosterol synthesis, and identical results were obtained with 14C-acetate and 14C-mevalonate, confirming that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity was not affected in these short-term studies. Several methylsterols that accumulated in the presence of garlic were identified by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as 4,4'-dimethylzymosterol and a possible metabolite of 4-methylzymosterol; both are substrates for sterol 4alpha-methyl oxidase, pointing to this enzyme as the principal site of inhibition in the cholesterolgenic pathway by garlic. Of 9 garlic-derived compounds tested for their ability to inhibit cholesterol synthesis, only diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, and allyl mercaptan proved inhibitory, each yielding a pattern of sterol accumulation identical with that obtained with garlic extract.

Se-methionine and Se-methylselenocysteine were determined by monitoring their product ions. Another compound, gamma-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine, shown to be the most abundant form of Se in the garlic, was determined without any additional sample pre-treatment after extraction and without the need for a synthesized standard. Product ions for this dipeptide were detected by LC-ESI-MS-MS for three isotopes of Se-78 Se, 80Se: and 82Se. The method was extended to the species extracted during in-vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Because both Se-methylselenocysteine and gamma-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine have anticarcinogenic properties, their extractability and stability during human digestion are very important. Garlic was also treated with saliva, to enable detection and analysis of species extracted during mastication. Detailed information on the extractability of selenium species by both simulated gastric and intestinal fluid are given, and variation of the distribution of Se among the different species with time is discussed. Although the main species in garlic is the dipeptide gamma-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine, Se-methylselenocysteine is the main compound present in the extracts after treatment with gastrointestinal fluids.

15949130,"Garlic extract significantly inhibited the oxidation of methyl linoleate in homogeneous acetonitrile solution, whereas the antioxidant effect of allicin-free garlic extract, prepared by removing allicin by prepared by removing allicin by preparative HPLC, was much lower than that of the garlic extract. These results suggest that the antioxidant properties are mostly attributed to the presence of allicin in the garlic extract. Allicin a major component of the thiosulfinates in garlic extract, was found to be effective for inhibiting methyl linoleate oxidation, but its efficiency was less than that of alpha-tocopherol. Next, the reactivity of allicin toward the peroxyl radical, which is a chain-propagating species, was investigated by direct ESR detection. The addition allicin to 2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile)-peroxyl radical solution caused the signal intensity of the peroxyl radical to dose-dependently decrease, indicating that allicin is capable of scavenging the the peroxyl radical and acting as an antioxidant. Finally, we studied the structure-anioxidant activity relationship for thiosulfinates and suggested that the combination of the allyl group (-CH2CH=CH2) and the -S(O)S- group is necessary for the antioxidant action of thiosulfinates in the garlic extract.

DNA was isolated and hydrolyzed, and O6MG/guanine ratios were determined by HPLC-fluorescence. Mean inhibition of O6MG formation fell from 89% for 200 to 33% for 12 mg diallyl sulfide (DAS) per kilogram gavaged 18 h before DMN injection. Gavage of DAS 3 or 6 h (instead of 18 h) before DMN injection significantly reduced inhibitions.

The noise was greatly reduced compared with that obtained by use of the UV-UV/TiO2 PCRD-KBH4-acid interface. The detection limits obtained for seleno-DL: -cystine (SeCys), selenite (Se(IV)), seleno-DL: -methionine (SeMet), and selenate (Se(VI)) were 2.1, 2.9, 4.3, and 3.5 ng mL(-1), respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to the speciation of selenium in water-soluble extracts of garlic shoots cultured with different selenium species.

Mechanistic and pharmacokinetic studies of allicin and its derivatives raise the need for a labeled compound. However, labeling of this volatile and unstable liquid requires delicate handling. Here, we describe a simple method for the preparation of (3)H-labeled allicin. This was achieved by applying synthetic [(3)H]alliin ([2,3-(3)H]allylcysteine sulfoxide) to a column containing immobilized alliinase [EC 4.1.1.4.] from garlic. Purification of [(3)H]allicin was done by differential adsorbtion of the reaction components on a neutral polystyrene resin, Porapak Q. Thiol-containing compounds are known to be the main target of allicin. In this work we demonstrated that [(3)H]allicin can be used for the synthesis of labeled [(3)H]allylmercapto derivatives of SH peptides and proteins.

This crop is mainly known for its flavor and odor, although the many medicinal properties that are attributed to it, including anticarcinogenic, antiatherosclerotic, and antithrombotic potential, among several others, have called the attention of scientists since very early times. It is known that sulfur-containing volatiles are the principal compounds responsible for such properties. The aims of this work were to develop a solventless extraction method for sulfur-containing volatiles from garlic, as well as their chemical characterization. Since garlic volatiles are rather thermolabile, low-pressure hydrodistillation was chosen as the extracting method. The analysis of all compounds was performed on an HP-FFAP chromatographic column mounted in a GC-MS system. For volatile transfer and injection method, solid-phase microextraction was selected, with the use of eight different fibers. The most abundant volatile compound was diallyl disulfide, followed by diallyl trisulfide.

This pest not only affects plants by sucking on the phloem, but it also transmits single-stranded RNA luteoviruses while feeding, which cause disease and damage in the crop. The mannose-binding Allium sativum (garlic) leaf lectin has been found to be a potent control agent of L. erysimi. The lectin receptor protein isolated from brush border membrane vesicle of insect gut was purified to determine the mechanism of lectin binding to the gut. Purified receptor was identified as an endosymbiotic chaperonin, symbionin, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Symbionin from endosymbionts of other aphid species have been reported to play a significant role in virus transmission by binding to the read-through domain of the viral coat protein. To understand the molecular interactions of the said lectin and this unique symbionin molecule, the model structures of both molecules were generated using the Modeller program. The interaction was confirmed through docking of the two molecules forming a complex. A surface accessibility test of these molecules demonstrated a significant reduction in the accessibility of the complex molecule compared with that of the free symbionin molecule. This reduction in surface accessibility may have an effect on other molecular interactive processes, including ""symbionin virion recognition"", which is essential for such symbionin-mediated virus transmission.

Optimum CO(2)-SFE conditions provided 96% recovery for allicin with precision of 3% (RSD) for repeat samples. The incorporation of an internal standard (allyl phenyl sulfone) in the SFE step resulted in a modest improvement in recovery (99%) and precision (2% RSD). Standard additions of alliin were converted to allicin in situ by endogenous alliinase (l-(+)-S-alk(en)ylcysteine sulfoxide lyase, EC 4.4.1.4). Complete conversion of the spiked alliin to allicin was achieved by making additions after homogenization-induced conversion of the naturally occurring cysteine sulfoxides to thiosulfinates had taken place, thus eliminating the likelihood of competing reactions. Concentration values for allicin determined in samples of fresh garlic (Allium sativum L. and Allium ampeloprasum) and commercially available garlic powders (Allium sativum L.) by standard addition of alliin were found in all cases to be in statistical agreement (95% confidence interval) with values determined using a secondary allicin standard (concentration determined using published extinction coefficients).

The nitrate () and nitrite () contents of various vegetables (Chinese cabbage, radish, lettuce, spinach, soybean sprouts, onion, pumpkin, green onion, cucumber, potato, carrot, garlic, green pepper, cabbage and Allium tuberosum Roth known as Crown daisy) are reported. Six hundred samples of 15 vegetables cultivated during different seasons were analysed for nitrate and nitrite by ion chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometry, respectively. No significant variance in nitrate levels was found for most vegetables cultivated during the summer and winter harvests. The mean nitrates level was higher in A. tuberosum Roth (5150 mg kg(-1)) and spinach (4259 mg kg(-1)), intermediate in radish (1878 mg kg(-1)) and Chinese cabbage (1740 mg kg(-1)), and lower in onion (23 mg kg(-1)), soybean sprouts (56 mg kg(-1)) and green pepper (76 mg kg(-1)) compared with those in other vegetables. The average nitrite contents in various vegetables were about 0.6 mg kg(-1), and the values were not significantly different among most vegetables. It was observed that nitrate contents in vegetables varied depending on the type of vegetables and were similar to those in vegetables grown in other countries. From the results of our studies and other information from foreign sources, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to establish limits of nitrates contents of vegetables cultivated in Korea due to the co-presence of beneficial elements such as ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol which are known to inhibit the formation of nitrosamine.",Survey of nitrate and nitrite contents of vegetables grown in Korea.,"['Allium', 'Belgium', 'Brassica', 'Capsicum', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Diet', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', 'Korea', 'Nitrates', 'Nitrites', 'Onions', 'Raphanus', 'Seasons', 'Soybeans', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'United Kingdom', 'Vegetables']","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'adverse effects', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry']",,garlic,0.16853932584269662,"['nitrate', 'green pepper', 'alpha-tocopherol', 'ascorbic acid', 'Allium', 'nitrosamine', 'nitrates', 'nitrite']",1,15
12852574,"A method is described for determining sulfite in dried garlic. Garlic is extracted with an HCl solution to inhibit the formation of allicin, which interferes with the determination of sulfite. After cleanup of the extract on a C18 solid-phase extraction column, sulfite is converted to hydroxymethylsulfonate (HMS) by adding formaldehyde and heating to 50 degrees C. HMS is determined by reversed-phase ion-pairing liquid chromatography with post-column detection. The post-column reaction system consists of the addition of KOH to convert HMS to sulfite ion, followed by the addition of 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) to produce 5-mercapto-2-nitrobenzoic acid which is detected spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. Background levels in unsulfited dried garlic equivalent to < 20 ppm SO2 were found. Recoveries of HMS from spiked garlic averaged 94.8% with a coefficient of variation of 3.8%. Sulfite was found in 13 of 21 samples of dried garlic produced in China, with sulfite ranging from 114 to 445 ppm. Sulfite was found in 60% of commercial dried garlic products purchased locally.

This paper shows that garlic powder extracts (GPE) and single garlic metabolites modulate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine levels in human whole blood. GPE-altered cytokine levels in human blood sample supernatants reduced nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity in human cells exposed to these samples. Pretreatment with GPE (100 mg/L) reduced LPS-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta from 15.7 +/- 5.1 to 6.2 +/- 1.2 micro g/L and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha from 8.8 +/- 2.4 to 3.9 +/- 0.8 micro g/L, respectively, whereas the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was unchanged. The garlic metabolite diallydisulfide (1-100 micro mol/L) also significantly reduced IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. Interestingly, exposure of human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293) cells to GPE-treated blood sample supernatants (10 or 100 mg/L) reduced NF-kappaB activity compared with cells exposed to untreated blood supernatants as measured by a NF-kappaB-driven luciferase reporter gene assay. Blood samples treated with extract obtained from unfertilized garlic (100 mg/L) reduced NF-kappaB activity by 25%, whereas blood samples treated with sulfur-fertilized garlic extracts (100 mg/L) lowered NF-kappaB activity by 41%.

The study features are the use of a mild nonionic detergent, 40-80% saturation with (NH4)2SOm4, maintained at low temperature to remove impurity, and the use of chromatografic columns to concentrate the acid phosphatase and remove non-acid phosphatase proteins with lower or higher molecular weights. Acid phosphatase was isolated and purified from garlic seedlings by a streamline method without the use of proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes, butanol, or other organic solvents. Grown garlic seedlings of 10- 15 cm height were homogenized with 0.1 M acetate buffer containing 0.1 M NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100. After homogenization, the supernatant was filtered with paper filters. Filtrated supernatant was cooled to 4 degrees C, followed by a threestep fractionation of the proteins with ammonium sulfate. The crude enzyme was isolated as a green precipitate that was dissolved in a small amount of 0.1 M acetate buffer containing 0.1 M NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100. Garlic seedling acid phosphatase was purified with ion-exchange chromatography (DEAE cellulose). The column was equilibrated with 0.1 M acetate buffer. Acid phosphatase was purified 40-fold from the starting material. The specific activity of the pure enzyme was 168 U/mg. A variety of stability and activity profiles were determined for the purified garlic seedling acid phosphatase: optimum pH, optimum temperature, pH stability, temperature stability, thermal inactivation, substrate specificity, effect of enzyme concentration, effect of substrate concentration, activation energy, and effect of inhibitor and activator. The molecular mass of acid phosphatase was estimated to be 58 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The optimum pH was 5.7 and the optimum temperature was 50 degrees C. The enzyme was stable at pH 4.0-10.0 and 40-60 degrees C.

Until now no analytical method was able to quantify simultaneously allicin, its direct precursor alliin (S-allyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide), SAC (S-allyl-L-cysteine) as well as various dipeptides that apparently serve as storage compounds in garlic. It is well known that all these intermediates are involved in the allicin biosynthetic pathway. A simple and rapid HPLC method suitable for routine analysis was developed using eluents containing an ion-pairing reagent. Particularly, heptanesulfonate as ion-pairing reagent guarantees a sufficient separation between alliin and the more retained dipeptides at very low pH. Allicin was eluted after 18 min on a 150 x 3 mm column. Synthetic reference compounds were characterized by the same chromatographic method using a diode-array UV detector and an ion trap mass spectrometer (electrospray ionization) in the multiple MS mode.

(2) MVA constitutes the precursor not only of cholesterol, but also of a number of non-sterol isoprenoids, such as farnesyl and geranylgeranyl groups. Covalent attachment of these MVA-derived isoprenoid groups (prenylation) is a required function of several proteins that regulate cell proliferation. We investigated the effect of ajoene on rat aortic smooth muscle cell proliferation as related to protein prenylation. (3) Cell counting, DNA synthesis, and cell cycle analysis showed that ajoene (1-50 micro M) interfered with the progression of the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and inhibited rat SMC proliferation. (4) Similar to the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin, ajoene inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis. However, in contrast to simvastatin, the antiproliferative effect of ajoene was not prevented by the addition of MVA, farnesol (FOH), and geranylgeraniol (GGOH). Labelling of smooth muscle cell cellular proteins with [3H]-FOH and [3H]-GGOH was significantly inhibited by ajoene. (5) In vitro assays for protein farnesyltransferase (PFTase) and protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (PGGTase-I) confirmed that ajoene inhibits protein prenylation. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry analyses also demonstrated that ajoene causes a covalent modification of the cysteine SH group of a peptide substrate for protein PGGTase-I.

We also used a qualitative technique to test the crude volatile fraction from I. felix and I. strobilina and dimethylsulfide in laboratory feeding assays. Crude organic extracts of all three species deterred feeding of fishes in both aquarium and field experiments. Bioassay-directed fractionation resulted in the isolation of the FTA fraction as the sole active fraction of the nonvolatile crude extract for each species, and further assays of subfractions suggested that feeding deterrent activity is shared by the FTAs. FTAs deterred fish feeding in aquarium assays at concentrations as low as 0.5 mg/ml (fraction B, variabilin), while the natural concentrations of combined FTA fractions were > 5.0 mg/ml for all three species. In contrast, natural mixtures of volatiles transferred from sponge tissue to food pellets and pure dimethylsulfide incorporated into food pellets were readily eaten by fish in aquarium assays.

It is generated upon the interaction of the nonprotein amino acid alliin with the enzyme alliinase (alliin lyase, EC 4.4.1.4).

This reagent is not commercially available and must be synthesized. In this paper we describe the quantitative analysis of alliin and allicin, as well as of alliinase activity with 4-mercaptopyridine (4-MP), a commercially available chromogenic thiol. The assay is based on the reaction of 4-MP (lambda(max)=324nm) with the activated disulfide bond of thiosulfinates -S(O)-S-, forming the mixed disulfide, 4-allylmercaptothiopyridine, which has no absorbance at this region.

The mercapturic acid was measured in urine using gaschromatography with mass spectrometry. Thus the intake of garlic was determined to check the compliance of garlic intake in a placebo-controlled intervention study.

11401577,"Allium sativum agglutinin (ASAI) is a heterodimeric mannose-specific bulb lectin possessing two polypeptide chains of molecular mass 11.5 and 12.5 kDa. The thermal unfolding of ASAI, characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism, shows it to be highly reversible and can be defined as a two-state process in which the folded dimer is converted directly to the unfolded monomers (A2 if 2U). Its conformational stability has been determined as a function of temperature, GdnCl concentration, and pH using a combination of thermal and isothermal GdnCl-induced unfolding monitored by DSC, far-UV CD, and fluorescence, respectively. Analyses of these data yielded the heat capacity change upon unfolding (DeltaC(p) and also the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic parameters, namely, DeltaG, DeltaH, and DeltaS. The fit of the stability curve to the modified Gibbs-Helmholtz equation provides an estimate of the thermodynamic parameters DeltaH(g), DeltaS(g), and DeltaC(p) as 174.1 kcal x mol(-1), 0.512 kcal x mol(-1) x K(-1), and 3.41 kcal x mol(-1) x K(-1), respectively, at T(g) = 339.4 K. Also, the free energy of unfolding, DeltaG(s), at its temperature of maximum stability (T(s) = 293 K) is 13.13 kcal x mol(-1). Unlike most oligomeric proteins studied so far, the lectin shows excellent agreement between the experimentally determined DeltaC(p) (3.2 +/- 0.28 kcal x mol(-1) x K(-1)) and those evaluated from a calculation of its accessible surface area. This in turn suggests that the protein attains a completely unfolded state irrespective of the method of denaturation. The absence of any folding intermediates suggests the quaternary interactions to be the major contributor to the conformational stability of the protein, which correlates well with its X-ray structure.

Here, we propose both a marker compound and a method for its analysis for the identification of garlic bulbs and their products. The constituents in 26 kinds of fresh edible parts of Allium vegetables and three types of garlic preparations were analyzed. Sulfur compounds are the most characteristic constituents in garlic, but manufacturing processes of garlic products dramatically affect these constituents. Thus, no sulfur compound could be specified as a universal marker of identification applicable for any type of garlic. On the other hand, garlic contains other characteristic compounds, namely, saponins.

The goal of this study was to compare certain biological activities of Se-garlic and Se-yeast and to elucidate the differences based on the chemical forms of selenium found in these two natural products. Characterization of organic selenium compounds in yeast (1922 microg/g Se) and garlic (296 microg/g Se) was carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry or with electrospray mass spectrometry. Analytical speciation studies showed that the bulk of the selenium in Se-garlic and Se-yeast is in the form of gamma-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine (73%) and selenomethionine (85%), respectively. The above methodology has the sensitivity and capability to account for >90% of total selenium. In the rat feeding studies, supplementation of Se-garlic in the diet at different levels consistently caused a lower total tissue selenium accumulation when compared to Se-yeast. On the other hand, Se-garlic was significantly more effective in suppressing the development of premalignant lesions and the formation of adenocarcinomas in the mammary gland of carcinogen-treated rats. Given the present finding on the identity of selenomethionine and gamma-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine as the major form of selenium in Se-yeast and Se-garlic, respectively, the metabolism of these two compounds is discussed in an attempt to elucidate how their disposition in tissues might account for the differences in cancer chemopreventive activity.",Chemical speciation influences comparative activity of selenium-enriched garlic and yeast in mammary cancer prevention.,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents', 'Carcinogens', 'Female', 'Garlic', 'Humans', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Precancerous Conditions', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Selenium Compounds', 'Sodium Selenite', 'Yeasts']","['chemically induced', None, 'therapeutic use', None, None, 'therapeutic use', None, 'chemically induced', None, None, 'chemically induced', None, None, 'therapeutic use', 'therapeutic use', None]",0.0,garlic,0.14814814814814814,"['selenomethionine', 'selenized garlic', 'garlic (296 microg/g Se', 'selenium', 'gamma-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine']",1,12

In particular, a comparison was made between the level of control of breath odor provided by the test dentifrice, and that provided by a placebo dentifrice which did not contain triclosan or a copolymer. This study followed a two-treatment, two-period crossover design. Prospective subjects were provided with a supply of a commercially available fluoride dentifrice, which was used for a one-week period prior to the two seven-day treatment periods. During each treatment period, subjects were instructed to brush their teeth twice a day, morning and evening, for sixty seconds with their assigned study dentifrice, using the soft-bristled toothbrush which had been provided. On the morning following the seventh day of each treatment period, subjects reported to the clinical facility for overnight breath odor assessments. Directly following this, subjects brushed their teeth, ate and drank normally, and reported once again to the clinical facility at seven hours post-toothbrushing for another breath odor assessment. Prior to the overnight breath odor assessments, subjects refrained from brushing their teeth, rinsing their mouths or using breath mints, and from eating or drinking anything on the morning of the evaluation. Subjects refrained from the use of tobacco products, and from eating onions, garlic, or strong spices throughout the entire study. Breath odor was instrumentally evaluated by measuring the level of volatile sulfur compounds in the mouth air using a 565 Tracor gas chromatograph equipped with a flame photometric detector. Measurements were taken in duplicate, and then averaged. Levels of volatile sulfur compounds were expressed in nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) of mouth air.

10578481,"Heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs), a group of chemicals formed during high-temperature cooking of meat and fish, are potent mutagens and are suspected to play a role in colorectal cancer. A recent study suggested that marinating meat may offer a way to reduce HAA formation. Hawaii's diverse ethnic populations, which are at various risks of colorectal cancer, often use traditional marinades when cooking meat. We compared the HAA content of beef steaks marinated overnight with teriyaki sauce, turmeric-garlic sauce, or commercial honey barbecue sauce with that of unmarinated steaks. The levels of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) were determined by liquid-liquid extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Beef steaks marinated with teriyaki sauce had 45% and 67% lower PhIP level at 10 minutes (p = 0.002) and 15 minutes (p = 0.001) of cooking time as well as 44% and 60% lower MeIQx levels at 10 minutes (p = 0.008) and 15 minutes (p = 0.001), respectively, than unmarinated meat. Lower levels of PhIP and MeIQx were also observed in meat marinated with turmeric-garlic sauce. In contrast, marinating with barbecue sauce caused a 2.9- and 1.9-fold increase in PhIP (p < or = 0.005) and a 4- and 2.9-fold increase in MeIQx (p < or = 0.001) at 10 and 15 minutes, respectively. Differences in the mutagenic activities of marinated and unmarinated steaks, as measured by the Ames assay, paralleled the differences in PhIP and MeIQx levels. Future studies should test the effects of specific ingredients, including the water content of marinades, and the effect of reapplying barbecue sauce during cooking (to reduce charring) on HAA formation.",Effects of marinating with Asian marinades or western barbecue sauce on PhIP and MeIQx formation in barbecued beef.,"['Asia', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Cooking', 'Flavoring Agents', 'Humans', 'Meat', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Risk Factors', 'Salmonella typhimurium', 'Western World']","[None, 'chemically induced', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'genetics', None]",,garlic,0.1566265060240964,"['marinades', '2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline', '2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b]pyridine', 'Heterocyclic aromatic amines', 'PhIP', 'MeIQx']",1,13

10497175,"We report herein for the first time the formation by freshly grown garlic roots and the structural characterization of 14,15-epoxide positional analogs of the hepoxilins formed via the 15-lipoxygenase-induced oxygenation of arachidonic acid. These compounds are formed through the combined actions of a 15(S)-lipoxygenase and a hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HPETE) isomerase. The compounds were formed when either arachidonic acid or 15-HPETE were used as substrates. Both the ""A""-type and the ""B""-type products are formed although the B-type compounds are formed in greater relative quantities. Chiral phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis confirmed the formation of hepoxilins from 15(S)- but not 15(R)-HPETE, indicating high stereoselectivity of the isomerase. Additionally, the lipoxygenase was of the 15(S)-type as only 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid was formed when arachidonic acid was used as substrate. The structures of the products were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the methyl ester trimethylsilyl ether derivatives as well as after characteristic epoxide ring opening catalytically with hydrogen leading to dihydroxy products. That 15(S)-lipoxygenase activity is of functional importance in garlic was shown by the inhibition of root growth by BW 755C, a dual cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, a lipoxygenase inhibitor. Additional biological studies were carried out with the purified intact 14(S), 15(S)-hepoxilins, which were investigated for hepoxilin-like actions in causing the release of intracellular calcium in human neutrophils. The 14,15-hepoxilins dose-dependently caused a rise in cytosolic calcium, but their actions were 5-10-fold less active than 11(S), 12(S)-hepoxilins derived from 12(S)-HPETE. These studies provide evidence that 15(S)-lipoxygenase is functionally important to normal root growth and that HPETE isomerization into the hepoxilin-like structure may be ubiquitous; the hepoxilin-evoked release of calcium in human neutrophils, which is receptor-mediated, is sensitive to the location within the molecule of the hydroxyepoxide functionality.","Formation of 14,15-hepoxilins of the A(3) and B(3) series through a 15-lipoxygenase and hydroperoxide isomerase present in garlic roots.","['8,11,14-Eicosatrienoic Acid', 'Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Garlic', 'Humans', 'Intramolecular Oxidoreductases', 'Neutrophils', 'Plant Roots', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Receptors, Cell Surface']","['analogs & derivatives', 'metabolism', None, 'enzymology', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'enzymology', None, 'metabolism']",0.0,garlic,0.1891891891891892,"['arachidonic acid', 'hepoxilins', 'calcium', 'hydrogen', 'nordihydroguaiaretic acid', 'dihydroxy', 'hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid', 'methyl ester trimethylsilyl ether', '15-HPETE', 'hydroxyepoxide functionality']",1,14

The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity and results were compared with those obtained from a sample of fresh A. sativum var. pekinense. The purification of the enzyme involved a gel filtration step as well as affinity chromatography on concanavalin-A agarose. Vmax using L-(+)-alliin as substrate (252 mumol min-1 mg-1) was at the lower range of data given in the literature (214-390 mumol min-1 mg-1).

9488677,"Two mannose-binding lectins, Allium sativum agglutinin (ASA) I (25 kDa) and ASAIII (48 kDa), from garlic bulbs have been purified by affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration. The subunit structures of these lectins are different, but they display similar sugar specificities. Both ASAI and ASAIII are made up of 12.5- and 11.5-kDa subunits. In addition, a complex (136 kDa) comprising a polypeptide chain of 54 +/- 4 kDa and the subunits of ASAI and ASAIII elutes earlier than these lectins on gel filtration. The 54-kDa subunit is proven to be alliinase, which is known to form a complex with garlic lectins. Constituent subunits of ASAI and ASAIII exhibit the same sequence at their amino termini. ASAI and ASAIII recognize monosaccharides in mannosyl configuration. The potencies of the ligands for ASAs increase in the following order: mannobiose (Manalpha1-3Man) < mannotriose (Manalpha1-6Manalpha1-3Man) approximately mannopentaose < Man9-oligosaccharide. The addition of two GlcNAc residues at the reducing end of mannotriose or mannopentaose enhances their potencies significantly, whereas substitution of both alpha1-3- and alpha1-6-mannosyl residues of mannotriose with GlcNAc at the nonreducing end increases their activity only marginally. The best manno-oligosaccharide ligand is Man9GlcNAc2Asn, which bears several alpha1-2-linked mannose residues.

9399673,"There is a growing need for short-term and cost-effective bioassay to assess the efficacy of potential chemo-preventive agents. We report that the induction of glutathione (GSH) S-transferase pi (mGSTP1-1) by a chemo-preventive agent can be used as a reliable marker to assess its efficacy in retarding chemical carcinogenesis induced by benzo(a)pyrene (BP), which is a widespread environmental pollutant and believed to be a risk factor in human chemical carcinogenesis. This conclusion is based on 1) the relative contribution of mGSTP1-1 of the liver and forestomach of female A/J mice in the detoxification of the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of BP, (+)-anti-7,8-dihydroxy-9, 10-oxy-7,8,9, 10-tetrahydrobenzo(a)pyrene [(+)-anti-BPDE]; and 2) a positive correlation between the induction of hepatic and forestomach mGSTP1-1 by 5 naturally occurring organosulfides (OSCs) from garlic (diallyl sulfide, diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, dipropyl sulfide and dipropyl disulfide) and their effectiveness in preventing BP-induced forestomach neoplasia in mice. In the liver, the combined contribution of other GSTs in the detoxification of (+)-anti-BPDE was far less than the contribution of mGSTP1-1 alone. Likewise, in the forestomach, the contribution of mGSTP1-1 far exceeded the combined contribution of other GSTs. Studies on the effects of OSCs against BP-induced forestomach neoplasia revealed a good correlation between their chemo-preventive efficacy and their ability to induce mGSTP1-1 expression in the liver (r = -0.89; p < 0.05) as well as in the forestomach (r = -0.97; p < 0.05).

Autoantibodies to sTNF-R (the 55-kDa extracellular domain of the human receptor to tumor necrosis factor alpha) were affinity purified from normal human sera using immobilized sTNF-R. The isolated anti-sTNF-R IgG bound both native and denatured forms of the receptor with low affinity. These antibodies also bound to different proteins and therefore are considered to be polyreactive. We used the anti-sTNF-R antibodies and purified polyreactive antibodies to mannose-specific lectin from garlic (Allium sativum) for screening a peptide library displayed on filamentous M13 phage. After the biopanning procedure, we failed to find epitopes with a consensus sequence; however, we found that proline is the most frequent amino acid in the selected phagotopes. Proline is commonly present at solvent-exposed sites in proteins, such as loops, turns, N-terminal first turn of helix, and random coils.

The mutagenic activity of the sample extracts was also measured, using the Ames/Salmonella assay. Mutagenic activity was lower in marinated samples cooked for 10, 20 and 30 min, but higher in the marinated samples cooked for 40 min, compared with unmarinated controls. Although a change in free amino acids, which are heterocyclic amine precursors, might explain the decrease in PhIP and increase in MeIQx, no such change was detected. Marinating chicken in one ingredient at a time showed that sugar was involved in the increased MeIQx, but the reason for the decrease in PhIP was unclear.

9084912,"The chemoprotective effects of diallyl sulfide (DAS), a flavor component of garlic, have been attributed to its inhibitory effects on CYP2E1-mediated bioactivation of certain carcinogenic chemicals. In addition to being a competitive inhibitor of CYP2E1 in vitro, DAS is known to cause irreversible inhibition of CYP2E1 in rats in vivo. The latter property is believed to be mediated by the DAS metabolite diallyl sulfone (DASO2), which is thought to be a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP2E1, although the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In order to investigate the nature of the reactive intermediate(s) responsible for the inactivation of CYP2E1 by DAS and its immediate metabolites, the present studies were carried out to detect and identify potential glutathione (GSH) conjugates of DAS and its metabolites diallyl sulfoxide (DASO) and DASO2. By means of ionspray LC-MS/MS, ten GSH conjugates were identified in bile collected from rats dosed with DAS, namely: S-[3-(S'-allyl-S'-dioxomercapto)-2-hydroxypropyl]glutathione (M1, M2; diastereomers), S-[3-(S'-allyl-S'-dioxomercapto)-2-hydroxypropyl]-glutathione (M5), S-[2-(S'-allyl-S'-dioxomercapto)-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glutathion e (M3, M4; diastereomers), S-[3-(S'-allylmercapto)-2-hydroxypropyl]glutathione (M6), S-(3-hydroxypropyl)-glutathione (M7), S-(2-carboxyethyl)glutathione (M8), allyl glutathionyl disulfide (M9), and S-allylglutathione (M10). With the exception of M6, all of the above GSH conjugates were detected in the bile of rats treated with DASO, while only M3, M4, M5, M7, M8, and M10 were found in the bile of rats treated with DASO2. Experiments conducted in vitro showed that GSH reacted spontaneously with DASO to form conjugates M9 and M10, and with DASO2 to form M10. In the presence of NADPH and GSH, incubation of DAS with cDNA-expressed rat CYP2E1 resulted in the formation of metabolites M6, M9, and M10, while incubation with DASO led to the formation of M3, M4, M5, M9, and M10. When DASO2 acted as substrate, CYP2E1 generated only conjugates M3, M4, M5, and M10. These results indicate that while DAS and DASO undergo extensive oxidation in vivo at the sulfur atom, the allylic carbon, and the terminal double bonds, CYP2E1 preferentially catalyzes oxidation of the sulfur atom to form the sulfoxide and the sulfone (DASO and DASO2). However, it appears that the end product of this sequence, namely, DASO2, undergoes further CYP2E1-mediated activation of the olefinic pi-bond, a reaction which transforms many terminal olefins to potent mechanism-based P450 inhibitors. We hypothesize, therefore, that it is this final metabolic event with DASO2 which leads to autocatalytic destruction of CYP2E1 and which is mainly responsible for the chemoprotective effects of DAS in vivo.",Metabolism of the chemoprotective agent diallyl sulfide to glutathione conjugates in rats.,"['Allyl Compounds', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Bile', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Glutathione', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sulfides']","[None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, 'metabolism']",0.0,garlic,0.24691358024691357,"[""S-[3-(S'-allylmercapto)-2-hydroxypropyl]glutathione"", 'GSH', 'allyl glutathionyl disulfide', 'DASO', 'NADPH', 'sulfur', ""S-[3-(S'-allyl-S'-dioxomercapto)-2-hydroxypropyl]glutathione"", 'S-(2-carboxyethyl)glutathione', ""S-[3-(S'-allyl-S'-dioxomercapto)-2-hydroxypropyl]-glutathione"", 'sulfone', 'carbon', 'diallyl sulfoxide', 'glutathione', 'S-allylglutathione', 'S-(3-hydroxypropyl)-glutathione', 'diallyl sulfide', 'olefins', 'CYP2E1', 'sulfoxide', 'diallyl sulfone', 'DAS']",1,40

Pretreatment with DAS protected animals from APAP-induced liver toxicity in a time- and dose-dependent fashion.

The metabolism of APAP (50 microM) in vitro was significantly inhibited by DAS (0.3-1 mM) in liver microsomes isolated from F344 rats. As the effect of DAS on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in vivo was observed only when DAS was administered before or shortly after (< 3 hr) APAP dosing, data suggested that the protective effect of DAS is mainly at the metabolic activation step of APAP.

By comparing the retention times of authentic IQ compounds from boiled pork juice with those following the addition of DAD, we showed that the mutagenicity of three major fractions was significantly inhibited compared with those same fractions in boiled pork juice alone. In addition, the Maillard reaction products (MRPs) in the boiled pork juice with and without the addition of DAD were quantified and identified by capillary gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results show that the reduction in the total amount of MRPs (pyridines, pyrazines, thiophenes and thiazoles) in boiled pork juice after boiling for 12 h is correlated with their mutagenicity. Among the MRPs, tetrahydrothiophene-3-one exhibited the strongest correlation. These data suggest that the inhibition of IQ mutagen formation by DAD is mediated through the reduction of MRPs production.",Naturally occurring diallyl disulfide inhibits the formation of carcinogenic heterocyclic aromatic amines in boiled pork juice.,"['Allyl Compounds', 'Amines', 'Animals', 'Carcinogens', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Disulfides', 'Heterocyclic Compounds', 'Maillard Reaction', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Meat Products', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Quinolines', 'Salmonella typhimurium', 'Sulfides', 'Swine']","[None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'pharmacology', 'metabolism', None, None, 'toxicity', None, 'metabolism', 'drug effects', 'pharmacology', None]",,garlic,0.23655913978494625,"['dipropyl disulfide', '2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline', '2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline', 'heterocyclic aromatic amines', 'allyl mercaptan', 'cysteine', 'pyridines, pyrazines', 'DAD', 'diallyl sulfide', 'organosulfur', 'DPD', 'allyl methyl sulfide', 'organosulfur compounds - diallyl disulfide', '2-amino-3-methyl-imidazo[4', 'DAS']",1,22

8717417,"Garlic has been reported to provide protection against hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis and ischemia-reperfusion-induced arrhythmias and infarction. Oxygen free radicals (OFRs) have been implicated as causative factors in these diseases and antioxidants have been shown to be effective against these conditions. The effectiveness of garlic in these disease states could be due to its ability to scavenge OFRs. However, the OFR-scavenging activity of garlic is not known. Also it is not known if its activity is affected by cooking. We therefore investigated, using high pressure liquid chromatography, the ability of garlic extract (heated or unheated) to scavenge exogenously generated hydroxyl radical (.OH). .OH was generated by photolysis of H2O2 (1.2-10 mumoles/ml) with ultraviolet (UV) light and was trapped with salicylic acid (500 nmoles/ml). H2O2 produced .OH in a concentration-dependent manner as estimated by .OH adduct products 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) and 2,5-DHBA. Garlic extract (5-100 microliters/ml) produced an inhibition (30-100%) of 2,3-DHBA and 2,5-DHBA generated by photolysis of H2O2 (5.00 pmoles/ml) in a concentration-dependent manner. Its activity is reduced by 10% approximately when heated to 100 degrees C for 20, 40 or 60 min. The extent of reduction in activity was similar for the three heating periods. Garlic extract prevented the .OH-induced formation of malondialdehyde in the rabbit liver homogenate in a concentration-dependent manner. It alone did not affect the MDA levels in the absence of .OH.

8870956,"N-Acetyl-S-allyl-L-cysteine (allylmercapturic acid, ALMA) was previously detected in urine from humans consuming garlic. Exposure of rats to allyl halides is also known to lead to excretion of ALMA in urine. ALMA is a potential biomarker for exposure assessment of workers exposed to allyl halides. It is not known whether garlic consumption can lead to urinary concentrations of ALMA which may interfere with biological monitoring of exposure to allyl halides by determination of urinary ALMA. Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine the cumulative excretion and the excretion kinetics of ALMA in urine of humans consuming garlic. Six human volunteers were given orally two garlic tablets, each containing 100 mg garlic extract (each representing 300 mg fresh garlic). Three of the volunteers consumed additional garlic after the garlic tablet intake. Urine samples were collected up to 24 h after the intake of the garlic tablets. ALMA was identified in the urine using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and determined quantitatively with a limit of detection of 0.10 microgram/ml with gas chromatography with sulphur selective detection. The total amount of ALMA found in urine of volunteers who consumed two garlic tablets was 0.43 +/- 0.14 mg (n = 3). In the urine of the three volunteers who consumed not only two garlic tablets but also additional fresh garlic, a significantly higher amount of ALMA was excreted in the urine, 1.4 +/- 0.2 mg (n = 3). The elimination half-life of ALMA, estimated from urinary excretion rate versus time curves, was 6.0 +/- 1.3 h (n = 5). One volunteer, who ate additional garlic, showed an irregular elimination profile and was excluded from this estimation. The highest urinary concentration of ALMA found in this study was 2.2 micrograms/ml. In a preliminary biological monitoring study of exposure in workers with potential exposure to allyl chloride (AC) up to the occupational exposure limit of 1 ppm (8-h TWA), we recently found urinary ALMA concentrations up to 4 micrograms/ml. Based on the results presented here, we conclude that garlic consumption is a potential confounder when monitoring human exposure to allylhalides and other chemicals leading to ALMA excretion when ALMA is used as a biomarker of exposure.",Urinary excretion of N-acetyl-S-allyl-L-cysteine upon garlic consumption by human volunteers.,"['Acetylcysteine', 'Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Garlic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Plants, Medicinal']","['analogs & derivatives', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",,garlic,0.07758620689655173,"['AC', 'acid', 'allyl halides', 'allyl chloride', 'allylhalides', 'garlic extract', 'N-Acetyl-S-allyl-L-cysteine']",1,9
8806047,"Diallyl sulfone (DASO2) is a metabolite of diallyl sulfide, a compound derived from garlic. The present study investigated the effect of DASO2 as a protective agent against acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. Oral administration of DASO2 protected mice against the APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. When administered 1 hour prior to, immediately after, or 20 minutes after a toxic dose of APAP, DASO2 at a dose of 25 mg/kg completely protected mice from development of hepatotoxicity, as indicated by liver histopathology and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels. Protective effect was observed when DASO2 at a dose as low as 5 mg/kg was given to mice 1 hour prior to APAP administration. Oral administration of DASO2 to mice 1 hour prior to a toxic dose of APAP significantly inhibited the APAP-induced glutathione depletion in the liver. DASO2 treatment also decreased the levels of oxidative APAP metabolites in the plasma without affecting the concentrations of nonoxidative APAP metabolites. In liver microsomes, 0.1 mM of DASO2 caused a 60% decrease in the rate of APAP oxidation to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, which was determined as glutathione conjugate. This inhibitory effect is mainly due to its inhibition of cytochrome P450 2E1 activity; with an IC50 value equal to 0.11 mM. DASO2 also slightly inhibited the activities of P450s 3A and 1A, with IC50 values > 5 mM. Furthermore, a single oral dose of DASO2 inactivated P450 2E1- and P450 1A-dependent activities in liver microsomes. The results suggest that the protective effect of DASO2 against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity is due to its ability to block acetaminophen bioactivation mainly by the inactivation and inhibition of P450 2E1.",Protective effect of diallyl sulfone against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in mice.,"['Acetaminophen', 'Administration, Oral', 'Allyl Compounds', 'Analgesics, Non-Narcotic', 'Animals', 'Benzoquinones', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutathione', 'Imines', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microsomes, Liver', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Sulfones']","['administration & dosage', None, 'administration & dosage', 'administration & dosage', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'blood', 'drug effects', None, None, 'drug effects', None, 'administration & dosage']",,garlic,0.14583333333333334,"['Diallyl sulfone', 'lactate', 'glutathione', 'N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine', 'APAP', 'acetaminophen', 'diallyl sulfide', 'glutathione conjugate']",1,14

We show that it is capable of detecting and quantifying trace gases, in complex mixtures such as breath, which are present at partial pressures down to about 10 parts per billion. Following discussions of the principles involved in this SIFT method of analysis, of the experiments which we have carried out to establish its quantitative validity, and of the air and breath sampling techniques involved, we present sample data on the detection and quantification of trace gases on the breath of healthy people and of patients suffering from renal failure and diabetes. We also show how breath ammonia can be accurately quantified from a single breath exhalation and used as an indicator of the presence in the stomach of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. Health and safety applications are exemplified by analyses of the gases of the gases of cigarette smoke and on the breath of smokers. The value of this analytical method in environmental science is demonstrated by the analyses of petrol vapour, car exhaust emissions and the trace organic vapours detected in town air near a busy road. Final examples of the value of this analytical method are the detection and quantification of the gases emitted from crushed garlic and from breath following the chewing of a mint, which demonstrate its potential in food and flavour research. Throughout the paper we stress the advantages of this SIFT method compared to conventional mass spectrometry for trace gas analysis of complex mixtures, emphasizing its selectivity, sensitivity and real-time analysis capability. Finally, we note that whilst the current SIFT is strictly laboratory based, both transportable and portable instruments are under construction and development.

The measured activity was referred to 35S-alliin (35S-alliin equivalents). The blood activity levels in each group were monitored for 72 h. For 35S-allicin and the labeled vinyldithiines the excretion with the urine, feces, and exhaled air was also measured. The distribution among the organs (whole-body autoradiography) and the urinary metabolite pattern (thin-layer chromatography) were also determined. For 35S-alliin the blood activity profile differed considerably from those of 35S-allicin and the labeled vinyldithiines: both the absorption and the elimination of the radioactivity were distinctly faster than for the other garlic constituents, maximum blood levels being reached within the first 10 min and elimination from the blood being almost complete after 6 h. For the other garlic constituents the maximum blood levels were not reached until 30-60 min (35S-allicin) or 120 min (vinyldithiines) p.a. and blood levels > 1000 ng-Eq/ml were still present at the end of the study after 72 h. The mean total urinary and fecal excretion after 72 h was 85.5% (35S-allicin) or 92.3% (labeled vinyldithiines) of the dose. The urinary excretion indicates a minimum absorption rate of 65% (35S-allicin) or 73% (vinyldithiines). It is uncertain whether the 19-21% recovered in the feces was unabsorbed substance or had been excreted via the bile or intestinal mucosa. The exhaled air showed only traces of activity although the whole-body autoradiographs, after fairly long exposure (96 h), showed distinct enrichment of activity in the mucosa of the airways and pharynx. The activity is deposite mainly in the cartilage of the vertebral column and ribs. There was no detectable difference in organ distribution between 35S-allicin and the labeled vinyldithiines. All that could be established from the urinary metabolite pattern was that unchanged 35S-allicin and unchanged labeled vinyldithiines are absent. There is therefore extensive metabolization. The metabolites must have a very polar structure with acid functional groups since satisfactory separation was achievable only with acid solvent systems. Conjugates with sulfuric or glucuronic acid were not detectable. These results reveal no differences in pharmacokinetic behavior between 35S-allicin and the labeled vinyldithiines.

Comparative values are given from a background area, namely a domestic garden located in the North Yorkshire Dales National Park area. Analysis was undertaken by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma-source mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with quality control assessment using four international biological reference materials; BCR:CRM 62 Olive Leaves, NIST 1575 Pine Needles, NIST 1573 Tomato Leaves, and NIST 1572 Citrus Leaves. Inter-analytical method comparison is given using two methods of ICP-MS; namely conventional pneumatic nebulisation of sample solution, and direct solids analysis by laser ablation; and neutron activation analysis methods (NAA). For the elements listed there is a good precision obtained by ICP-MS and NAA. In particular levels of < +/- 1-10% (rsd) are obtained. Comparison of data with certified values and other analytical methods are generally of very good agreement. Lead levels in background areas ranged from 0.0008 to 0.340 microgram/g (fresh weight) for plant material; with the lead magnitude greater for grasses > herbs > vegetables > cereals > fruits. Measured values are in good agreement with reported literature values. The lowest Pb values are for marrow, lettuce, tomato and sweet corn samples (approximately 0.001-0.021 microgram/g). 'Green' leaf material levels were approximately 0.02-0.10 microgram/g (i.e. sprouts and cabbage). Root vegetables contain higher levels, approximately 0.02-0.125 microgram/g (especially carrot), reflecting possible metal uptake from soil. The highest vegetable Pb values are for leek and onion (approximately 0.35 microgram/g). Background values are also provided for nineteen elements (Al, As, B, Ba, Br, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Rb, Se, Sr, V, and Zn). Exposure to motor vehicle activities at a site some 30 m from the M25 shows only significant increases in Pb for unwashed plant material and surface soils. Typically Pb levels of 40-80% can be removed by washing plant surfaces resulting in metal levels similar to background areas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Metal dispersion and transportational activities using food crops as biomonitors.,"['Air Pollutants', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Lead', 'London', 'Plants, Edible', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Vehicle Emissions']","['analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None]",,garlic,0.14193548387096774,"['Fe', 'Cd', 'rosemary', 'Ni', 'Pb', 'NAA', 'Pine', 'Mn', 'Li', 'Mg', 'Se', 'Zn', 'Cu', 'Sr', 'Ca', 'Ce']",1,22

Sequence comparison of the different cDNA clones isolated revealed three types of lectin clones called LECAUAG0, LECAUAG1 and LECAUAG2, which besides the obvious differences in their sequences also differ from each other in the number of potential glycosylation sites within the C-terminal peptide of the lectin precursor. In vivo biosynthesis studies of the ramson lectins have shown that glycosylated lectin precursors occur in the organelle fraction of radioactively labeled ramson bulbs. Despite the similarities between the A. ursinum and the A. sativum (garlic) lectins at the protein level, molecular cloning of the two ramson lectins has shown that the lectin genes in A. ursinum are organized differently. Whereas in A. sativum the lectin polypeptides of the heterodimeric ASAI are encoded by one large precursor, those of the heterodimeric AUAI lectin are derived from two different precursors. These results are confirmed by Northern blot hybridization of A. ursinum RNA which, after hybridization with a labeled lectin cDNA, reveals only one band of 800 nucleotides in contrast to A. sativum RNA which yields two bands of 1400 and 800 nucleotides.

1516037,"N-Nitroso compounds (NOCs) are known to be strong carcinogens in various animals including primates (Preussman and Stewart, (1984) N-Nitroso Compounds). Human exposure to these compounds can be by ingestion or inhalation of preformed NOCs or by endogenous nitrosation from naturally occurring precursors (Bartsch and Montesano, Carcinogenesis, 5 (1984) 1381-1393; Tannebaum (1979) Naturally Occuring Carcinogens, Mutagens and Modulators of Carcinogenesis; Shephard et al., Food Chem. Toxicol., 25 (1987) 91-108). Several factors present in the diet can modify levels of endogenously formed nitrosamines by acting as catalysts or inhibitors. Compounds in the human diet that alter nitrosamine formation would thus play an important role in carcinogenesis study. Earlier researchers have reported the nitrite scavenging nature of sulphydryl compounds (Williams, Chem. Soc. Rev., 15 (1983) 171-196). We therefore studied the modifying effect of sulphydryl compounds viz., cysteine (CE), cystine (CI), glutathione (GU), cysteamine (CEA), cystamine (CEI), cysteic acid (CIA) and thioglycolic acid (TGA) on the nitrosation of model amines viz., pyrrolidine (PYR), piperidine (NPIP) and morpholine (NMOR). Many of these compounds are present in the food we consume. The present work also describes the inhibitory effect of onion and garlic juices on the nitrosation reactions. Both onion and garlic are known to contain sulphur compounds (Block, Sci. Am., 252 (1985) 114-119).
