31759609,"Infant formulations are constantly evolving as novel protein ingredients are added to make them more closely mimic the protein profile of human milk; however, precise analytical methods for characterizing and quantifying the major milk proteins in such formulations are currently lacking. This article describes an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry method for intact proteins that can efficiently detect, identify, and characterize the major milk proteins and their proteoforms (phosphorylation status, degree of glycation, genetic variants among others) in ingredients and final products, with an emphasis on detecting and quantifying specific genetic variants of β-casein in infant formulas. Method sensitivity allows detection of β-casein A1 in A2-based infant formulas with a limit of detection of 2% (grams of β-casein A1 per 100 g of total β-casein). Protein glycation affects signal intensity in a linear fashion, which permits proteins to be quantified from their mass spectrometry signals after correction according to their measured glycation index. The method was validated for the quantification of β-casein in infant formulas. Repeatability ranged from 2 to 3% and intermediate reproducibility from 5 to 9%. Calculated β-casein amounts ranged between 77 and 110% of the values based on formulations and published protein profiles for milk. Altogether, this method can be used for general fingerprinting as well as specific characterization and quantification of individual major milk proteins in dairy-based ingredients and products.",Journal of dairy science,[],[],Protein fingerprinting and quantification of β-casein variants by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31759609,2019,0
31689314,"Exposure to high levels of manganese (Mn) in children has recently been associated with adverse neurodevelopmental effects. Current infant formula regulations for Mn content were set between 1981 (United States), 2006 (European Union, France), and 2007 (Codex Alimentarius) prior to the publication of much of the growing body of research on the developmental neurotoxicity of Mn. In this study, we sought to measure the concentrations of Mn in some infant formulas and young child nutritional beverages available on the United States (US) and French markets using ion beam analysis by particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) spectrometry and then compare the analytical results to concentrations reported in the literature for breast milk and applicable infant formula regulations and guidelines. We were particularly interested in measuring Mn concentrations in product types for which there is very little data from previous surveys, especially soy-based, rice-based, goat-milk based, chocolate-flavored, and nutritional beverages for young children that are not regulated as infant or follow-on formulas (e.g. ""toddler formulas"" and ""toddler powders""). We purchased 44 infant formulas and young child nutritional beverage products in the US and France with varying protein sources (cow-milk, goat-milk, soy, rice) labelled for birth to 3 years. We selected these samples using maximum variation sampling to explore market extremes to facilitate comparisons to regulatory limits. Since this sampling method is non-probabilistic, other inferences cannot be made beyond this set of samples to the overall markets. We used ion beam analysis to measure the concentrations of Mn in each product. The range of measured Mn concentrations in the products is 160-2,800 μg/L, substantially higher than the 3-6 μg/L mean Mn concentration reported in human breast milk. All products satisfied national and Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) international standards for minimum Mn content in infant formulas; however, 7/25 of the products purchased in the US exceeded the CAC Guidance Upper Level of 100 μg Mn/kcal for infant formula.",PloS one,[],[],Manganese levels in infant formula and young child nutritional beverages in the United States and France: Comparison to breast milk and regulations.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689314,2019,0
31677836,"The aim of this study was to characterize minor lipids in methanol fraction extracted from raw camel milk after loading it on a water-preconditioned short C18 open column and fractionating with a gradient of methanol/water. The C18 column showed high fractionation efficiency of minor lipids, such as glycosphingolipids, lipopolysaccharides, or oligosaccharides, when compared with other constituents, in particular polysaccharides, proteins, and free fatty acids. Liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in negative ion mode was used to identify 21 new glycosphingolipids, lipopolysaccharides, and oligosaccharides. Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was qualified to provide relevant data for recognizing the molecular mass, glycosylation sequences, and structure of saccharide moieties for the revealed compounds. The sequence of combinations of one selected lipopolysaccharide, which was considered the backbone of the remaining lipopolysaccharides, was confirmed in a density functional theory study.

31654257,"The objectives of this study were to assess levels of contamination of breast milk (BM) by cadmium (Cd) among lactating mothers from Rabat, Morocco, and to investigate its association with several maternal habits, parameters, and factors. In addition, to estimate the daily intake of the newborns. Cd concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in 70 human milk samples collected between the 2nd and 5th day postpartum. Accuracy of the analysis was checked by various methods including the use of reference material. A structured questionnaire was filled during the collection of milk reporting data concerning anthropometric, sociodemographic parameters, dietary and cosmetic habits, etc. The median (range) of Cd in human milk was 0.49 μg/L (range 0.013-95.19 μg/L) respectively. In 21 (30%) of 70 samples, Cd levels were higher than the normal reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) in BM (< 1 μg/L). Indeed, several factors affect significantly Cd levels in BM of the mothers such as low maternal education level, preterm delivery, cesarean delivery, and area of residence. Also, the frequency of consumption of milk and dairy products as well dried fruits and wheat bread and the frequency of use of cosmetic powders. However, the daily intake of cadmium by the newborns was lower than tolerable daily intake of the WHO for 97% of them. Our results revealed low cadmium concentrations in human milk samples from Moroccan lactating mothers living in Rabat, also the association of some factors with the levels of contamination found in this population.",Biological trace element research,[],[],Cadmium Contamination in Breast Milk of Moroccan Lactating Women and the Associated Factors: CONTAMILK Study.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654257,2019,0
31629509,"The high nutritional value of sheep milk can be advantageous in the manufacture of cheese, and fat plays an important role in sheep cheese properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of feeding common hay or silage diets used in commercial farms on the nutritional value of sheep cheese fat. We also monitored the effect of cheese ripening period on the fatty acid profile. Cheeses were produced from milk of sheep fed hay and silage diets from 8 farms, on 4 separate occasions (February, May, August, and November) over a 1-yr period. Eighty-four individual fatty acids were determined and identified by gas chromatography. Ripening time (100 and 180 d) significantly reduced moisture, acidity, and water activity of cheeses but did not affect the fatty acid content. However, hay feeding, compared with silage feeding, led to cheeses with 1.5- and 1.3-fold higher contents of vaccenic acid and conjugated linoleic acid, without detrimental changes in saturated and n-3 (omega-3) fatty acid composition. Hay forages could be a low-cost alternative for producing cheese with a fatty acid profile suitable for human health, which is an aspect of great interest to the food industry.",Journal of dairy science,[],[],Effect of forage type in the ovine diet on the nutritional profile of sheep milk cheese fat.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629509,2019,0
31525238,"Bovine milk extracellular vesicles (EVs) attract research interest as carriers of biologically active cargo including miRNA from donor to recipient cells to facilitate intercellular communication. Since toxicity of edible milk seems to be negligible, milk EVs are applicable to use for therapeutics in human medicine. Casein separation is an important step in obtaining pure EVs from milk, and recent studies reported that adding hydrochloric acid (HCl) and acetic acid (AA) to milk accelerates casein aggregation and precipitation to facilitate EV isolation and purification; however, the effects of acidification on EVs remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated the acidification effects on milk-derived EVs with that by standard ultracentrifugation (UC). We separated casein from milk by either UC method or treatment with HCl or AA, followed by evaluation of EVs in milk serum (whey) by transmission electron microcopy (TEM), spectrophotometry, and tunable resistive pulse sensing analysis to determine EVs morphology, protein concentration, and EVs size and concentration, respectively. Moreover, we used anti-CD9, -CD63, -CD81, -MFG-E8, -HSP70, and -Alix antibodies for the detection of EVs surface and internal marker proteins by western blot (WB). Morphological features of EVs were spherical shape and similar structure was observed in isolated EVs by TEM. However, some of the EVs isolated by HCl and AA had shown rough surface. Although protein concentration was higher in whey obtained by UC, EV concentration was significantly higher in whey following acid treatment. Moreover, although all of the targeted EVs-marker-proteins were detected by WB, HCl- or AA-treatments partially degraded CD9 and CD81. These findings indicated that acid treatment successfully separated casein from milk to allow efficient EV isolation and purification but resulted in partial degradation of EV-surface proteins. Our results suggest that following acid treatment, appropriate EV-surface-marker antibodies should be used for accurate assess the obtained EVs for downstream applications.

31521344,"Over the past decades, several studies investigated the health-promoting functions of milk peptides. However, to date many hurdles still exist regarding the widespread use of milk-derived bioactive peptides, as they may be degraded during gastrointestinal digestion. Thus, the aim of our study was to in vitro digest intact whey protein isolate (WPI) and casein proteins (CNP), mimicking in vivo digestion, to investigate their bioactive effects and to identify the potential peptides involved. Whey protein isolate and CNP were digested using a pepsin-pancreatin protocol and ultra-filtered (3-kDa cutoff membrane). A permeate (<3 kDa) and a retentate (>3 kDa) were obtained. Soy protein was included as a control (CTR). Angiotensin-1-converting enzyme inhibitory (ACE1-I) and antioxidant activity (AOX) were assessed and compared with those observed in undigested proteins and CTR. Furthermore, the permeate was characterized by nano-liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-nano ESI MS/MS) using a shotgun peptidomic approach, and retentate was further digested with trypsin and analyzed by MS using a shotgun proteomic approach to identify potentially bioactive peptides. Further, the effects of WPI, CNP, and CTR retentate on cell metabolic activity and on mucus production (MUC5AC and MUC2 gene expression) were assessed in intestinal goblet HT29-MTX-E12 cells. Results showed that WPI permeate induced a significant ACE1-I inhibitory effect [49.2 ± 0.64% (SEM)] compared with undigested WPI, CNP permeate, and retentate or CTR permeate (10.40 ± 1.07%). A significant increase in AOX (1.58 ± 0.04 and 1.61 ± 0.02 µmol of trolox AOX equivalents per mg of protein, respectively) upon digestion was found in WPI. Potentially bioactive peptides associated with ACE1-I and antihypertensive effects were identified in WPI permeate and CNP retentate. At specific concentrations, WPI, CNP, and CTR retentate were able to stimulate metabolic activity in HT29-MTX-E12 cells. Expression of MUC5AC was increased by CNP retentate and unaltered by WPI retentate; MUC2 expression was significantly increased by 0.33 mg/g of CNP and reduced by 1.33 mg/g of CNP.

31492911,"Accurate postmortem estimation of breastfeeding status for archaeological or forensic neonatal remains is difficult. Confident identification of milk-specific proteins associated with these remains would provide direct evidence of breast milk consumption. We used liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS) to confidently identify beta-lactoglobulin-1 (LGB1) and whey acidic protein (WAP), major whey proteins associated with a neonatal dog (Canis lupus familiaris) skeleton (430-960 cal AD), from an archaeological site in Hokkaido, Japan. The age at death of the individual was estimated to be approximately two weeks after birth. Protein residues extracted from rib and vertebra fragments were analyzed and identified by matching tandem MS spectra against the dog reference proteome. A total of 200 dog protein groups were detected and at least one peptide from canine LGB1 and two peptides from canine WAP were confidently identified. These milk proteins most probably originated from the mother's breast milk, ingested by the neonate just before it died. We suggest the milk diffused outside the digestive apparatus during decomposition, and, by being absorbed into the bones, it partially preserved. The result of this study suggests that proteomic analysis can be used for postmortem reconstruction of the breastfeeding status at the time of death of neonatal mammalian, by analyzing their skeletal archaeological remains.

In today's world of changing food habits and environmental pollution, there is concern if milk is what we think it to be. In the present work, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/selected reaction monitoring (UPHPLC-MS/SRM) methods have been developed and validated for quantitative estimation of 21 different B-vitamins [B1-3, B2-3, B3-2, B5-1, B6-5, B8-1, B9-2 vitamins, total choline (betaine, choline and acetylcholine)] from a drop (50 µL) and B12 from 500 µL of milk. These two methods qualify all essential bio-analytical parameters (recovery >80%, accuracy <±15%, variation <±10%) and are highly reproducible. By using these developed methods, B-vitamins in different fresh milk samples from cow, goat, buffalo and pasteurized cow milk (each 10 and total n = 40) were analysed. Total choline is the highest (6.5-10.5 µg/mL) and vitamin B8 is the lowest (16.1-32.9 ng/mL) in all milk samples. Inverse correlation between vitamin B2 and B5 was observed in milk samples. The ratio of vitamin B5/B2 was checked in all milk samples, it is higher in cow (2.64), equal in goat (1.04) and lower in buffalo (0.42) milk. Total B-vitamin content in cow milk is higher (10.5 µg/mL) compared to other three (goat-7.2, buffalo-6.5, pasteurized-8.8 µg/mL). Vitamin B12 is higher in cow milk (3.6 ng/mL) compared to other two fresh milk samples. Different isomers for vitamin B6 were noticed in the fresh milk samples.

Carotenoids in human milk were measured by liquid chromatography. Bile salt stimulated lipase was completely eliminated by holder pasteurization, decreased at 600 MPa, and remained intact at 200 + 400 MPa; 450 MPa. The fatty acid composition and structure of human milk fat triacylglycerols were unchanged. The lipids of human milk after holder pasteurization had the lowest content of free fatty acids and the shortest induction time compared with samples after HPP.

These highly heterogeneous molecules are collectively referred to as xenoestrogens and hold the potential to affect and alter the delicate hormonal balance of the human body. To monitor exposure and investigate potential health implications, comprehensive analytical methods covering all major xenoestrogen classes are needed but not available to date. Herein, we describe a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous determination of multiple classes of endogenous as well as exogenous estrogens in human urine, serum, and breast milk to enable proper exposure and risk assessment. In total, 75 analytes were included, whereof a majority was successfully in-house validated in the three matrices. Extraction recoveries of validated analytes ranged from 71% to 110% and limits of quantification from 0.015 to 5 μg/L, 0.03 to 14 μg/L, and 0.03 to 4.6 μg/L in urine, serum, and breast milk, respectively. The applicability of the novel method was demonstrated in proof-of-principle experiments by analyzing urine from Austrian individuals and breast milk from Austrian and Nigerian individuals. Thereby, we proved the methods' feasibility to identify and quantify different classes of xenoestrogens simultaneously.

Specifically, we identified up to 2117 unique peptides in 10 commercial dairy products, which together represent the most comprehensive peptidomic profiling of dairy milk in the literature to date. The quantity of peptides, measured by ion-exchange chromatography, varied between 60 and 130 mg/L among the same set of dairy products, which the majority originated from caseins, and the remaining from whey proteins.

In addition, 24 unique oligosaccharide compositions were identified in all the samples by nano LC Chip QTOF. Neutral oligosaccharides were the most abundant class in all samples (66-91.3%), followed by acidic (8.6-33.7%), and fucosylated oligosaccharides (0-4.6%). Variation of total oligosaccharide concentration ranged from a high of 65.78 to a low of 24.82 mg/L.

We quantified these elements in breast milk from Norwegian mothers and determined their association with dietary habits, maternal amalgam fillings, and smoking. Breast milk (n = 300) from the Norwegian Human Milk Study (HUMIS) was analyzed using triple quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, after an acidic decomposition using microwave technique. We used multiple linear regression to examine predictors of Hg and Cd in breast milk, and logistic regression to test predictors of Pb above the quantification limit. The median breast milk concentrations (minimum - maximum) were 0.20 μg Hg/kg (<0.058-0.89), 0.057 μg Cd/kg (0.017-1.2), and <0.67 μg Pb/kg (<0.2-7.5). Cadmium showed no significant relation with any exposure variable investigated. Lead was associated with intake of liver and kidneys from game.

With the popularity of low-fat dairy products, improving the flavor of skim milk is a main focus for food scientists.

In this study, to explore the optimal processing conditions, milk was preheated at 30 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C for 30 min prior to defatting. When the optimal temperature was determined, milk was then preheated at the optimal temperature for 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 40 min and 50 min, respectively, to obtain the best preheating time. Distinctions between skim milk samples with different processing conditions were studied by sensory evaluation, e-tongue and HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis. Principle components analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) were selected to associate with e-tongue results and compare the similarities and differences among the skim milks. Sensory and e-tongue results matched and both showed that a preheating temperature of 50 °C and 30 min time might be the optimal combination of processing conditions. Thirteen volatiles, including ketones, acids, aldehydes, alcohols, alkanes and sulfur compounds, were analyzed to evaluate flavor of the skim milks produced by different preheating treatments.

These tools must be capable of rapid throughput with highly sensitive quantitation for use in clinical studies that probe their fate in human and animal fluids and tissues.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002241', 'D004040', 'D005504', 'D006801', 'D013058']","['Animals', 'Carbohydrates', 'Dietary Carbohydrates', 'Food Analysis', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry']",Function without Structures: The Need for In-Depth Analysis of Dietary Carbohydrates.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378', None, None, None]","[None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30925054,2019,0

Assessment of mycotoxins human exposure through processed diet is an important component of food safety strategies. The present review explores and summarises total diet studies (TDS) carried out in different countries focusing on mycotoxins determination. TDS were classified by samples preparation, mycotoxins analysis and dietary exposure evaluation. Most of reviewed TDS performed multi-mycotoxins analysis in composite samples mainly, prepared taking into account local culinary habits. High performance liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detector was the predominant and the most sensitive technique used for determination. Ochratoxin A was the most analyzed mycotoxin, followed by trichothecenes, aflatoxins, zearalenone, fumonisins, patulin, enniatins, and beauvericin respectively. Alternaria toxins and ergot alkaloids were also included. Food commonly analyzed were cereals, meat, vegetables, fruits, nuts and beverages. The findings in food were in below the current European legislation, except for some sporadic samples of wine and milk meaning less than 1% of total analyzed samples.

The success in harmonization was confirmed with inter-laboratory trials using skim milk powder as a standardized model food. Moreover, the physiological relevance of the gastric and intestinal endpoints of the static digestion protocol was demonstrated in a pig in vivo trial, with the same skim milk powder and samples collected from different sections of the digestive tract, as well as in a human study with from jejunal effluents. In vivo, digestion is a dynamic process influenced by peristalsis and by the gradual secretion of enzymes and juices and the dwell time of the food. To mimic these physiological mechanisms, dynamic in vitro digestion protocols are widely used. Until now, the differences of protein hydrolysis taking place during dynamic and static in vitro digestion have not been investigated. In this study, the gradual hydrolysis of the main milk proteins present in skim milk powder was digested with the dynamic DIDGI®-system using adult digestion protocol and the static harmonized INFOGEST method. Protein hydrolysis was analyzed by gel electrophoresis, peptide patterns were measured with mass spectrometry, and free amino acids with high pressure liquid chromatography. The peptide patterns at the gastric and intestinal endpoints of in vitro digestion showed a good approximation to the in vivo results from pigs. Moreover, gradual peptide generation was comparable in both in vitro digestion conditions. However, the dynamic protocol reflected the physiological situation better at the level of free amino acid release. Nonetheless, in both in vitro digestion protocols, absorption of free amino acids is not simulated, and they are therefore limited in reflecting the in vivo situation at this level.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",[],[],Digestion of milk proteins: Comparing static and dynamic in vitro digestion systems with in vivo data.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30898349,2019,0

The purpose of this study was to assess the association between iodine concentrations in locally produced animal milk and in animal drinking water and further to assess the risk of exceeding European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) tolerable upper intake level for iodine (600 μg/d) among Saharawi women. In 2009 and 2010, 202 milk samples from goats and sheep and 52 milk samples from camel were collected. Iodine in milk was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). In addition, iodine in 56 water samples from the general water system and 54 water samples from wells, was determined by modified Sandell-Kolthoff reaction. Animal milk is generally consumed mixed with water. The median (min, max) iodine intake from goat/sheep milk mixed with water in camps with high iodine content in human drinking water was 284 (57, 2889) μg/d and 19% of participants exceeded EFSA upper intake level for iodine. The median (min, max) iodine intake from camel milk mixed with water in all camps was 2100 (210, 11100) and 47% of participants exceeded the EFSA upper intake level.

Conventional diagnosis is based on positive allergy studies and evaluation of parameters including IgE and IgG1 levels, acute allergic skin response and anaphylactic shock reactions. We developed a cell membrane chromatographic (CMC) method based on human mast cells (HMC-1) for screening potential allergens in infant formula milk powders (IFMP). HMC-1 cell membranes were extracted and mixed with silica to prepare cell membrane chromatography columns (10 mm × 2 mm i.d., 5 µm). Under the conditions of 0.2 mL/min flow rate and 214 nm detection wavelength, human breast milk showed no retention. However, IFMP showed clear retention. The retained fractions were collected and analyzed through matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Four major milk proteins, i.e., α-casein, β-casein, α-lactalbumin, and β-lactoglobulin A, were identified. Furthermore, these proteins and β-lactoglobulin B showed clear retention on HMC-1/CMC columns. To test the degranulation effects of the five proteins, histamine and β-hexosaminidase release assays were carried out. All five proteins induced HMC-1 cells to release histamine and β-hexosaminidase. Also, we established a reversed phase liquid chromatographic (RPLC) method for the determination of the five proteins in IFMP and the results showed that 90% proteins in IFMP were α-casein and β-casein. We concluded that cow's milk proteins may be potential allergens and caseins cause more β-casein allergic risk than other proteins.

Forty mothers and their 1-2-month-old exclusively breastfeed infant were included in the study. The questionnaires about sociodemographic characteristics and possible BPA exposure history were filled out. Breast milk and urine samples were taken. BPA analyses of these samples were conducted using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. All mother-infant pairs showed detectable BPA concentrations. The geometric means of BPA levels in breast milk, maternal urine, and infant urine were determined as 0.12 μg/L (0.03-0.59), 0.12 μg/L (0.03-0.73), and 0.13 μg/L (0.02-0.44), respectively. Infants whose mothers were consuming yoghurt in plastic containers had relatively higher urinary BPA levels (p = 0.00). Mothers consuming hot beverages in plastic glass showed higher breast milk BPA levels (p = 0.033). There were no statistical associations between BPA levels and the use of plastic materials and tools (p > 0.05).Conclusion: The measurable BPA concentrations in all breast milk specimens of healthy mothers may reflect possible exposure from dietary or non-dietary sources.

Premature infants are often fed a combination of human milk and bovine milk fortifiers, but the variety of functional peptides released from both human and bovine milk proteins remains uncharacterized. This study applied peptidomics to investigate the peptides released in gastric digestion of mother's milk proteins and supplemental bovine milk proteins in premature infants. Peptides were assessed for homology against a database of known functional peptides-Milk Bioactive Peptide Database. The peptidomic data were analyzed to interpret which proteases most likely released them from the parent protein. We identified 5,264 unique peptides from bovine and human milk proteins within human milk, fortifier or infant gastric samples. Plasmin was predicted to be the most active protease in milk, while pepsin or cathepsin D were predicted to be most active in the stomach. Alignment of the peptide distribution showed a different digestion pattern between human and bovine proteins. The number of peptides with high homology to known functional peptides (antimicrobial, angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, etc.) increased from milk to the premature infant stomach and was greater from bovine milk proteins than human milk proteins.

In this study, label-free mass spectrometry analysis was conducted to quantitatively identify the whey proteins differentially expressed in high-milk-yield samples compared with low-milk-yield samples. A total of 216 whey proteins were identified, and 19 of them showed significant differences in high-milk-yield samples. Of these proteins, 16 were upregulated and 3 were downregulated. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were subjected to intensive bioinformatic analysis. Results revealed that the majority of DEPs participated in protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, estrogen signaling pathway, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Functional protein analysis suggested that proteins functioned in binding, catalytic activity, molecular function regulation, structural molecule activity, and transporter activity. Our study was the first to analyze the whey protein profile of different samples of donkey milk and to identify candidate proteins that could be used to explore the molecular mechanism related to the yield traits of Dezhou donkey milk.

This study aimed to determine the accuracy, sensitivity and applicability of the DMS method developed based on the PUFAcoat™ technology. Two hundred breast milk samples were analyzed using the conventional method and compared with the DMS method. In order to evaluate the usefulness of DMS for large scale international studies, we analyzed another 786 breast milk samples collected from mothers of preterm infants who participated in a large clinical trial conducted in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. Fatty acids were measured using capillary gas chromatography and results were reported as weight percentage of total fatty acids. Strong correlations and tight variation were observed in total saturated, monounsaturated, n-6 and n-3 PUFAs between the conventional and DMS methods. The DMS method proved to be sensitive in differentiating the breast milk fatty acid profiles of women consuming different habitual diets as evidenced by the differences between the breast milk fatty acid composition between Australian and Singaporean population.

The main aim of the study was to review the current data on PFASs in human breast milk, including the challenges of analysis as well as the possible modes of transfer from maternal blood. In this paper, previously published data on the concentrations of PFASs in human breast milk from around the world were reviewed and summarised. Eligible studies with reference lists published before 1 June 2017 were included by searching several databases (including Scopus, ScienceOpen and SciFinder). From this search, studies with the number of participants in each study ranging from 2 to 1237 were identified. The review indicated that based on the structural profiles and concentration levels, there was variation in the geographical distribution of these compounds in breast milk. Although there are no recorded investigations on the modes of transfer from maternal blood to breast milk, literature suggests that the PFASs tend to be transferred through binding to various proteins. The review also examined the different sample preparation and analytical methods employed to measure the concentrations of PFASs in human breast milk. This showed that solid phase extraction was the most common extraction method. After extraction, liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was the most common analysis method.

After lipid extraction, phospholipids (PL), cholesterol esters (CE), triacylglycerols (TG) and non-esterified fatty acids were separated by thin layer chromatography and analyzed by gas chromatography. Results Higher DHA concentrations in TL (37.24±21.87 mg/L), PL (13.14±8.07 mg/L) and triacylglycerols (2.24±2.21 mg/L) were recorded in mothers from the supplemented group when compared to the study group (TL 21.89±14.53 mg/L; P<0.001; PL 9.33±5.70 mg/L; P=0.013; TG 0.56±0.43 mg/L; P<0.001).

Thus, a novel dual-emission surface molecularly imprinted nanosensor is designed for the specific adsorption and detection of sulfadiazine. In the system, blue emissive carbon quantum dots wrapped with silica served as the internal reference signal for eliminating background interference, while red emissive thioglycolic acid modified CdTe quantum dots (CdTe QDs), which are low dimensional semiconductor materials by the combination of cadmium and tellurium with excellent optical properties, were encapsulated in the imprinted layer to offer recognition signal. The fluorescence of CdTe quantum dots was quenched and the fluorescence quenching degree of carbon quantum dots was inconspicuous with the increase of concentration of sulfadiazine, thereby reflecting the color change. The detection of sulfadiazine was successfully achieved in a concentration range of 0.25-20 μmol/L with detection limit of 0.042 μmol/L and nanosensors had specific recognition for sulfadiazine over its analogues.

30296645,"Caseins are a family of proteins constituted by α-caseins (αs-1 and αs-2 caseins), β-caseins and κ-caseins. β-caseins, in particular, show a temperature and concentration-dependent self-assembling behaviour. Recently, β-casein micelles have been proposed as natural nanocarriers for the delivery of hydrophobic compounds, promoting their bioavailability. Until now, all studies regarding both chemical-physical characterization and applications of β-caseins have employed the protein of bovine origin. However, it could be interesting to exploit the use of β-caseins from other milk sources for their potential encapsulation ability and immunogenicity but, at present, no information on the self-assembling behaviour is available for β-caseins from the milk of species different from bovine. In this work, for the first time, β-caseins from human milk and from donkey, goat, and sheep milk were purified and their self-assembling behaviour was compared to that of a commercial bovine β-casein, the only one for which the concentration and temperature aggregation behaviour is known. Furthermore, a preliminary evaluation of the immunogenicity potential of β-casein from other milk sources has been performed by cross-reaction experiments using anti-β-casein antibodies from bovine origin. The results indicated a similar self-assembling profile among all β-caseins examined compared to the bovine β-casein, suggesting the possible use of β-casein from other milk sources as nanocarriers. Since donkey and human β-casein do not cross-react with bovine anti-β-casein antibodies, they could be particularly interesting for the development of self-assembling systems with lower hypoallergenic potential.","Colloids and surfaces.

The colostrum, transitional milk and mature milk of thirty healthy lactating women were collected for analysis. Eighty-four differential metabolites over lactation stages were identified, including 12 fatty acyls, 15 glycerolipids, 23 glycerophospholipids, 7 sphingolipids, 7 vitamins, 5 nucleotides-related metabolites, 2 amino acids, 1 amino acid derivate, 9 dipeptides, 1 steroid hormone, 1 energy-related metabolite and 1 amine. Partial least-squares regression analysis indicated that the metabolite profiles of the colostrum, transitional milk and mature milk have a strong relationship with dietary intake (R2 values were 0.92, 0.87 and 0.74, respectively). However, among the 84 differential metabolites over lactation stages, only two showed a strong relationship with dietary intake: 1,24,25-(OH)3 vitamin D3 was positively correlated with the dietary intake of meat and eggs, protein and fat; 11β-hydroxyprogesterone was negatively correlated with the dietary intake of fruit and carbohydrate. After adjusting for dietary intake, the variation trend of all the 84 differential metabolites over lactation stages remained unchanged. In conclusion, 84 differential metabolites in the breast milk of Chinese women over lactation stages were identified, and their variation trend was independent of dietary intake. These metabolites were partially different from those identified in previous metabolomic studies in the Western population.

However, in contrast to garlic, ramson is in general not associated with an unpleasant breath following consumption. While there is data available regarding the metabolism of volatile garlic constituents in the human body, the metabolism of ramson was not yet addressed. To elucidate if ramson has an impact on the body odor, this study aimed at identifying volatile ramson-derived metabolites in human milk and urine. Therefore, milk and urine samples were gathered before and after ramson consumption, and were analyzed sensorially by a trained human sensory panel as well as chemo-analytically applying gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry (GC-MS/O). Sensory evaluation revealed a garlic-/cabbage like odor in milk samples obtained after ramson consumption, demonstrating that ramson consumption affected the milk aroma.

In particular, the potential for bioactive protein hydrolysates and peptides to enhance health in conjunction with conventional pharmaceutical therapy is being investigated. Dairy-derived proteins have been shown to contain bioactive peptide sequences with various purported health benefits, with effects ranging from the digestive system to cardiovascular circulation, the immune system and the central nervous system. Interestingly, the ability of dairy proteins to modulate metabolism and appetite has recently been reported. The ghrelin receptor (GHSR-1a) is a G-protein coupled receptor which plays a key role in the regulation of food intake. Pharmacological manipulation of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor-type 1a (GHSR-1a) receptor has therefore received a lot of attention as a strategy to combat disorders of appetite and body weight, including age-related malnutrition and the progressive muscle wasting syndrome known as cachexia. In this study, a milk protein-derivative is shown to increase GHSR-1a-mediated intracellular calcium signalling in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro. Significant increases in calcium mobilisation were also observed in a cultured neuronal cell line heterologously expressing the GHS-R1a. In addition, both additive and synergistic effects were observed following co-exposure of GHSR-1a to both the hydrolysate and ghrelin. Subsequent in vivo studies monitored standard chow intake in healthy male and female Sprague-Dawley rats after dosing with the casein hydrolysate (CasHyd). Furthermore, the provision of gastro-protected oral delivery to the bioactive in vivo may aid in the progression of in vitro efficacy to in vivo functionality. In summary, this study reports a ghrelin-stimulating bioactive peptide mixture (CasHyd) with potent effects in vitro.

30199719,"Objective Beta-casein is a major protein in breast milk and an important source for several bioactive peptides that are encrypted within the sequence. Beta-casomorphins (BCMs) are short-chain proteolytic peptides that are derived from the beta-casein protein and have opioid effects in newborns. Human milk is known to contain naturally occurring milk-protein-derived bioactive peptides but the identification of naturally occurring beta-casein-derived BCMs in human breast milk has been limited due to difficulties in the detection of BCM peptides, which are small and circulate in low concentrations. Methods The present study aimed to identify the naturally occurring BCM peptides from beta-casein in human breast milk using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The BCM peptides identified in the breast milk were analysed to predict the milk proteases responsible for the cleavage patterns using a computational tool EnzymePredictor. Results In-depth peptidomics analysis of breast milk samples that were collected at different lactation stages during human lactation revealed the presence of BCMs including BCM-8, -9, -10, and -11 as well as precursors and truncated forms of the original peptide, which suggests that milk protease activity in the mammary gland generates biologically relevant BCMs. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the presence of naturally occurring human BCM-10 and -11 in breast milk. Our study provides evidence of beta-casein-derived BCM peptides in human milk before infant digestion. Proteases that are present in milk are likely specific in their proteolysis of beta-casein.

Particularly, it is closest to human breast milk and has high levels of nutrients and bioactive components. The aim of this study was to explore the antioxidant peptides derived from protein fractions of camel milk. Camel milk proteins (CMP) were fractionated into camel casein protein (CCP) and camel whey protein (CWP), which were hydrolyzed with pepsin to produce peptic digests P-CCP and P-CWP, respectively. RP-HPLC was used for fractionation of the peptides from the P-CCP and P-CWP.

Active peptides were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) whereas a number of antioxidant peptides, with masses ranging from 913 to 2,951 Da, derived mainly from alpha-casein, lactophorin and lactoferrin, were identified. When yeast cells are used as a system for modeling mitochondrial disease, the peptides in caseins and whey fractions significantly enhanced the tolerance of yeast cells against peroxide-induced oxidative stress.

The EAA content and AA composition of the dietary protein source contribute to the differential muscle protein synthetic response to the ingestion of different proteins. Lower EAA contents and specific lack of sufficient leucine, lysine, and/or methionine may be responsible for the lower anabolic capacity of plant-based compared with animal-based proteins. We compared EAA contents and AA composition of a large selection of plant-based protein sources with animal-based proteins and human skeletal muscle protein. AA composition of oat, lupin, wheat, hemp, microalgae, soy, brown rice, pea, corn, potato, milk, whey, caseinate, casein, egg, and human skeletal muscle protein were assessed using UPLC-MS/MS. EAA contents of plant-based protein isolates such as oat (21%), lupin (21%), and wheat (22%) were lower than animal-based proteins (whey 43%, milk 39%, casein 34%, and egg 32%) and muscle protein (38%). AA profiles largely differed among plant-based proteins with leucine contents ranging from 5.1% for hemp to 13.5% for corn protein, compared to 9.0% for milk, 7.0% for egg, and 7.6% for muscle protein.

Whereas, TFA, conjugated linoleic acids (CLA), cis-C18:1, C18:2n-6, C18:3n-3 and C20:5n-3 were acylated at the sn-1, 3 positions of TAG in human milk. The composition of fatty acids in breast milk was closely related to the diet of lactating mothers. PUFA in breast milk was negatively correlated with the intake of protein, fat and meat, but positively correlated with the intake of carbohydrates. MUFA of human milk was negatively correlated with the intake of dairy products, eggs, fish and shrimp. SFA in breast milk was positively correlated with the maternal intake of meat. In addition, the present results showed that the composition of total fatty acids and sn-2 fatty acids in breast milk varied with the lactation period and the geographical regions in China; however, the regiospecific fatty acid profile seemed not to be affected by the lactation time and regions, although the quantities at each position could be changed.",Food & function,"['D000328', 'D002681', 'D003126', 'D003710', 'D004032', 'D005227', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D039382', 'D008895']","['Adult', 'China', 'Colostrum', 'Demography', 'Diet', 'Fatty Acids', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Milk, Human']","Fatty acid positional distribution in colostrum and mature milk of women living in Inner Mongolia, North Jiangsu and Guangxi of China.","[None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29999510,2018,0

The aim of this follow-up study was to assess the long-term effect of infant feeding on growth and to study whether the infant metabolome at the age of 4 months might predict anthropometry at 4 years of age. The Belgrade-Munich infant milk trial (BeMIM) was a randomized controlled trial in which healthy term infants received either a protein-reduced infant formula (1.89 g protein/100 kcal) containing alpha-lactalbumin enriched whey and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), or a standard formula (2.2 g protein/100 kcal) without LC-PUFA, focusing on safety and suitability. Non-randomized breastfed infants were used as a reference group. Of the 259 infants that completed the BeMIM study at the age of 4 months (anthropometry assessment and blood sampling), 187 children participated in a follow-up visit at 4 years of age. Anthropometry including weight, standing height, head circumference, and percent body fat was determined using skinfolds (triceps, subscapular) and bioelectrical impedance analysis. Plasma metabolite concentration, collected in samples at the age of 4 months, was measured using flow-injection tandem mass spectrometry. A linear regression model was applied to estimate the associations between each metabolite and growth with metabolites as an independent variable. At 4 years of age, there were no significant group differences in anthropometry and body composition between formula groups. Six metabolites (Asn, Lys, Met, Phe, Trp, Tyr) measured at 4 months of age were significantly associated with changes in weight-for-age z-score between 1 to 4 months of age and BMI-for-age z-score (Tyr only), after adjustment for feeding group. No correlation was found between measured metabolites and long-term growth (up to 4 years of age). No long-term effects of early growth patterns were shown on anthropometry at 4 years of age.

29936375,"Levels of essential metals in human breast milk (HBM) have been determined by different analytical techniques, but there is few woks about human whey milk fractions. However, the current trend lies in metalloproteomic and identification of different metalloproteins. In this sense, native separative techniques (N-PAGE and SEC) coupled to ICP-MS provide us with valuable information. Besides it is necessary the development of new methodologies in order to determine with accuracy and precision the profile of such metals and metalloproteins in the different whey protein fractions of HBM. Thus, the aim of this work was to develop a new method for metals and metalloproteins determination by SEC-ICP-MS in whey protein fractions of HBM. Human whey fractions were obtained of HBM samples by ultracentrifugation. Then, protein fractions of whey milk were separated by SEC coupled to ICP-MS for metalloproteins and Mn, Co, Cu and Se quantification. Besides, protein profile of whey milk was determined by N-PAGE and computer assisted image analysis. SEC-ICP-MS results indicated that first and second protein fractions showed detectable levels of the Mn, Co, Cu, and Se. Protein profile determined by N-PAGE and image analysis showed that molecular weight of protein fractions ranged between 68,878-1,228.277 Da. In this work, metalloproteins were analyzed by SEC coupled to ICP-MS, with adequate sensitivity and accuracy.

It was important to address this hypothesis, since cheese para-κ-casein could theoretically be used for the assessment of the origin of cheese milk by means of various analytical methods. Feta cheese was manufactured from sheep milk and from four different mixtures of sheep and goat milk in triplicate. The para-κ-casein of Feta samples taken during 120 d of ripening and storage was estimated by means of cation-exchange HPLC and proteolysis was determined in terms of free amino groups. Despite their similarity, sheep and goat para-κ-casein were efficiently separated and the changes of their chromatographic areas indicated that hydrolysis took place during the first stage of ripening. In accordance to the evolution of free amino groups, para-κ-caseins remained stable thereafter. The hydrolysis pattern was not affected by the composition of the cheese milk mixture and after 120 d at least two thirds of the initial quantity remained intact.

In this study, by oral administration of EBN to female mice during the pregnancy or lactation period, the effects of EBN on the levels of sialic acid in mouse milk were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Furthermore, the spatial learning performances of their offspring were assessed using the Morris water maze test. Additionally, cerebral malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in cubs nursed by the female mice given the EBN homogenate were examined, while BDNF immunohistochemical staining and neuron count in hippocampi were investigated as well. These results showed that administration with EBN in maternal mice during pregnancy or lactation period can improve the learning and memory functions in their offspring, possibly by increasing the activities of SOD and ChAT and, at the meantime, decreasing the levels of MDA and activities of AChE. Moreover, BDNF levels for CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions in hippocampi and the numbers of dyed neurons in CA1, CA2, CA3, and DG regions among the offspring were significantly enhanced due to the intake of EBN by the maternal mice.

29753473,"In the human intestine, lipids are absorbed as sn-2 monoglycerides (sn-2, also named β-position), produced mainly by pancreatic lipases, which hydrolysate the triglyceride molecule in positions 1 and 3 (sn-1,3, α-position). The fatty acids esterified in sn-2 are thus preferentially absorbed, which means that the bioavailability of a single fatty acid is affected by its position on the triglyceride. This experiment is carried out with the milk used to make cheese applied in a study with 42 human volunteers. In that study the authors detected an improvement in the blood lipid profile. The aim of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of this kind of cheese in improving human health by studying how linseed supplementation affects the milk fatty acid composition of the 3 different triglyceride positions and thus the fatty acid bioavailability. The sn-2 were obtained by reacting total milk lipids with swine pancreatic lipase. The milk came from 24 sheep fed a control diet and 24 sheep fed a diet containing 200 g of extruded linseed per day. The sn-2 were separated by thin-layer chromatography. The fatty acid composition of total lipids and sn-2 was obtained by a gas chromatography-flame ionization detector apparatus equipped with a high polar 100 m length capillary column. The bioavailability of the fatty acids was evaluated by a putative preferential intestinal absorption index (PPIAi), where PPIAi <0 indicated a disadvantageous nutritional condition and PPIAi >0 indicated a preferential intestinal absorption. With regard to the fatty acid composition of triglycerides, the linseed group showed a significantly higher content of both linolenic acid and rumenic acid compared with the control. As a consequence of linseed supplementation, the linolenic and rumenic acid content esterified in the β-position increased greatly. This was highlighted by the PPIAi.

29729920,"Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen affecting both human and animal species. An effective vaccine to prevent S. aureus bovine disease and transmission would have positive effects on animal well-being, food production, and human health. The objective of this study was to identify multiple antigens that are immunoreactive during udder colonization and disease for exploration as vaccine antigens to prevent bovine mastitis. Staphylococcus aureus produces several cell wall-anchored and surface-associated virulence factors that play key roles in the pathogenesis of mastitis. Many of these proteins are conserved between different strains of S. aureus and represent promising vaccine candidates. We used an immunoproteomics approach to identify antigenic proteins from the surface of S. aureus. The expression of cell wall and surface proteins from S. aureus was induced under low iron conditions, followed by trypsin extraction and separation by 2-dimensional electrophoresis. The separated proteins were blotted with antibodies from mastitic bovine milk and identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Thirty-eight unique proteins were identified, of which 8 were predicted to be surface exposed and involved in S. aureus virulence. Two surface proteins, iron-regulated surface determinant protein C (IsdC) and ESAT-6 secretion system extracellular protein (EsxA), were cloned, expressed, and purified from Escherichia coli for confirmation of immune reactivity by ELISA. A PCR of 37 bovine S. aureus isolates indicated that the presence of esxA and isdC is conserved, and amino acid alignments revealed that IsdC and EsxA sequences are highly conserved.

The response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize the microencapsulation condition of HMFS as a functional product. The microencapsulation efficiency (MEE) of microencapsulated HMFS was investigated with respect to four variables including concentration of soy lecithin (A), ratio of demineralized whey powder to malt dextrin (B), HFMS concentration (C), and homogenizing pressure (D). The optimum conditions for efficient microencapsulation of HMFS by the spray drying technique were determined as follows: the amount of soybean lecithin-0.96%, ratio of desalted whey powder to malt dextrin-2.04:1, oil content-17.37% and homogeneous pressure-0.46MPa. Under these conditions, the MEE was 84.72%, and the basic indices of the microcapsules were good. The structure of the microcapsules, as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), revealed spherical, smooth-surfaced capsules with diameters ranging between 10-50 μm. Compared with HFMS, the peroxide value (POV) and acid value (AV) of the microcapsule were significantly lower during storage indicating that the microencapsulation process increases stability and shelf life. Infrared spectroscopic analyses indicated that HFMS had the same characteristic functional groups as the oil extracted from microcapsules.

29501128,"Tetracyclines are widely used for both the treatment and prevention of diseases in animals as well as for the promotion of rapid animal growth and weight gain. This practice may result in trace amounts of these drugs in products of animal origin, such as milk and eggs, posing serious risks to human health. The presence of tetracycline residues in foods can lead to the transmission of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria through the food chain. In order to ensure food safety and avoid exposure to these substances, national and international regulatory agencies have established tolerance levels for authorized veterinary drugs, including tetracycline antimicrobials. In view of that, numerous sensitive and specific methods have been developed for the quantification of these compounds in different food matrices. One will note, however, that the determination of trace residues in foods such as milk and eggs often requires extensive sample extraction and preparation prior to conducting instrumental analysis. Sample pretreatment is usually the most complicated step in the analytical process and covers both cleaning and pre-concentration. Optimal sample preparation can reduce analysis time and sources of error, enhance sensitivity, apart from enabling unequivocal identification, confirmation and quantification of target analytes. The development and implementation of more environmentally friendly analytical procedures, which involve the use of less hazardous solvents and smaller sample sizes compared to traditional methods, is a rapidly increasing trend in analytical chemistry.

The secondary objectives were to determine which milk proteases participate in the proteolysis and to predict which released peptides have bioactivity. Lactating mothers (n = 4) expressed their milk directly into a mixture of antiproteases on ice followed by immediate freezing of the milk to limit post-expression protease activity. Samples were analyzed for their peptide profiles via mass spectrometry and database searching.

The findings demonstrate that human milk contains more than 1,100 unique peptides derived from milk protein hydrolysis within the mammary gland. These peptides derived from 42 milk proteins and included 306 potential bioactive peptides. Based on the peptidomics data, plasmin was predicted to be the milk protease most active in the hydrolysis of human milk proteins within the mammary gland.

A study of the effects of pH and temperature on the milk-clotting activity and proteolytic activity of the proteases showed that they exhibited good pH stability from pH 5.5 to 7.5 and good thermal stability at temperatures from 50 to 70°C. The QA and QC were the cysteine proteases, able to hydrolyze β-casein and κ-casein completely, and α-casein partially. The cleavage site on κ-casein determined by Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) analysis showed that QA and QC could cleave κ-casein at Ser132-Thr133. Overall, the results suggest that the Cynanchum otophyllum Schneid. proteases are a promising milk-clotting enzyme that could be used for manufacturing milk cake and cheese.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D002364', 'D031105', 'D057056', 'D006868', 'D008892', 'D008970', 'D010447', 'D059748', 'D013696']","['Animals', 'Caseins', 'Cynanchum', 'Cysteine Proteases', 'Hydrolysis', 'Milk', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Proteolysis', 'Temperature']",Characterization and milk coagulating properties of Cynanchum otophyllum Schneid. proteases.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000302', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', None, None]","[None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'isolation & purification', None, 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29428763,2018,0

We compared the distribution of concentrations of urinary inorganic arsenic plus methylated forms (uc(iAs+MMA+DMA)) in four Italian areas with other international studies, and we assessed the relationship between uc(iAs+MMA+DMA) and various exposure factors. We conducted a human biomonitoring study on 271 subjects (132 men) aged 20-44, randomly sampled and stratified by area, gender, and age. Data on environmental and occupational exposure and dietary habits were collected through a questionnaire. Arsenic was speciated using chromatographic separation and inductively coupled mass spectrometry. Associations between uc(iAs+MMA+DMA) and exposure factors were evaluated using the geometric mean ratio (GMR) with a 90% confidence interval by stepwise multiple regression analysis. The 95th percentile value of uc(iAs+MMA+DMA) for the whole sample (86.28 µg/L) was higher than other national studies worldwide. A statistical significant correlation was found between uc(iAs+MMA+DMA) and occupational exposure (GMR: 2.68 [1.79-4.00]), GSTT gene (GMR: 0.68 [0.52-0.80]), consumption of tap water (GMR: 1.35 [1.02-1.77]), seafood (GMR: 1.44 [1.11-1.88]), whole milk (GMR: 1.34 [1.04-1.73]), and fruit/vegetables (GMR: 1.37 [1.03-1.82]).

Nine subjects in good oral condition took part in the study. The acquired pellicle was formed in the morning, for 120 min, after prophylaxis with pumice. Following this, the volunteers rinsed with 10 mL of whole milk, fat-free milk, or deionized water for 30 s, following a blinded crossover protocol. After 60 min, the pellicle was collected with filter paper soaked in 3% citric acid and processed for analysis by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The obtained tandem mass spectrometry spectra were searched against a human protein database (Swiss-Prot). The proteomic data related to protein quantification were analysed using the PLGS software. A total of 260 proteins were successfully identified in the AEP samples collected from all groups. Forty-nine were common to all 3 groups, while 72, 62, and 49 were specific to the groups rinsing with whole milk, fat-free milk, and water, respectively. Some were typical components of the AEP, such as cystatin-B, cystatin-SN, isoforms of α-amylase, IgA and IgG, lysozyme C, protein S100 A78, histatin-1, proline-rich protein 27, statherin, and lactotransferrin. Other proteins are not commonly described as part of the AEP but could act in defence of the organism against pathogens. Distinct proteomic profiles were found in the AEP after rinsing with whole or fat-free milk, which could have an impact on bacterial adhesion and tooth dissolution.

29389253,"Bovine milk is important for both veterinary medicine and human nutrition. Understanding the bovine milk proteome at different stages of lactation has therefore broad significance for integrative biology and clinical medicine as well. Indeed, different lactation stages have marked influence on the milk yield, milk constituents, and nourishment of the neonates. We performed a comparative proteome analysis of the bovine milk obtained at different stages of lactation from the Indian indigenous cattle Malnad Gidda (Bos indicus), a widely available breed. The milk differential proteome during the lactation stages in B. indicus has not been investigated to date. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics of the bovine whey proteins at early, mid, and late lactation stages, we identified a total of 564 proteins, out of which 403 proteins were found to be differentially abundant at different lactation stages. As is expected of any body fluid proteome, 51% of the proteins identified in the milk were found to have signal peptides. Gene ontology analyses were carried out to categorize proteins altered across different lactation stages based on biological process and molecular function, which enabled us to correlate their significance in each lactation stage. We also investigated the potential pathways enriched in different lactation stages using bioinformatics pathway analysis tools. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first and largest inventory of milk proteins identified to date for an Indian cattle breed.

29344587,"Red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) contains a variety of polyphenols including anthocyanins and ellagitannins. Red raspberry polyphenols absorbed in different forms (parent compounds, degradants or microbial metabolites) are subject to xenobiotic metabolism in the intestine, liver, and/or kidney, forming methylate, glucuronide, and sulfate conjugated metabolites. Upon acute exposure, (poly)phenol/metabolite presence in the blood depends mainly on intestinal absorption, enterohepatic circulation, and metabolism by resident microbiota. However, chronic exposure to red raspberry polyphenols may alter metabolite patterns depending on adaptions in the xenobiotic machinery and/or microbiota composition. Understanding the metabolic fate of these compounds and their composition in different biological specimens relative to the exposure time/dose will aid in designing future health benefit studies, including the mechanism of action studies. The present exploratory study applied ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) and triple quadrupole (QQQ) mass spectrometries to characterize red raspberry polyphenols in fruit and then their appearance, including metabolites in human biological samples (plasma, urine and breast milk) after the chronic intake of red raspberries. The results suggested that the most abundant polyphenols in red raspberries included cyanidin 3-O-sophoroside, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, sanguiin H6 and lambertianin C. Sixty-two (poly)phenolic compounds were tentatively identified in the plasma, urine and breast milk samples after the intake of red raspberries.

Selling and buying human milk via the Internet has gained popularity. However, there is a risk of human milk sold containing other adulterants such as animal or plant milk. Analytical tools for rapid detection of adulterants in human milk are needed. We report a quantitative metabolomics method for detecting potential milk adulterants (soy, almond, cow, goat and infant formula milk) in human milk. It is based on the use of a high-performance chemical isotope labeling (CIL) LC-MS platform to profile the metabolome of an unknown milk sample, followed by multivariate or univariate comparison of the resultant metabolomic profile with that of human milk to determine the differences. Using dansylation LC-MS to profile the amine/phenol submetabolome, we could detect an average of 4129 ± 297 (n = 9) soy metabolites, 3080 ± 470 (n = 9) almond metabolites, 4256 ± 136 (n = 18) cow metabolites, 4318 ± 198 (n = 9) goat metabolites, 4444 ± 563 (n = 9) infant formula metabolites, and 4020 ± 375 (n = 30) human metabolites.

Gas chromatography with electron-capture detection (GC-ECD) was used to detect α-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), γ-HCH, g-chlordane, and α-chlordane in fresh milk, yogurt, and cheese. The results showed that fermentation reduced the residual concentration of OCPs in yogurt, with processing factors (PFs) ranging from 0.42 to 0.64. The reductions in residue levels during fermentation were due to the activity of the starter.

Milk heat treatments are the most common practices carried out to inhibit the microbial growth; therefore it is necessary to have analytical procedures that are more and more up-to-date and capable of detecting the effectiveness of the heat treatments. Most of the reference and official methods to assess heat treatment in milk are based on the evaluation of the modifications of some milk components following the thermal process, such as the determination of enzyme activities (alkaline phosphatase and lactoperoxidase), whey proteins, Maillard reaction compounds (generally furosine), and lactulose. Besides the most common techniques (liquid and gas chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, or spectroscopy) used for the detection of single thermal indicators, new approaches, such as chemometric studies or more recent techniques, including size-exclusion chromatography with online electrospray mass spectrometry or stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry, are discussed in this review in order to evaluate heat treatment in milk.",Journal of analytical methods in chemistry,[],[],New Trends for the Evaluation of Heat Treatments of Milk.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29230345,2019,0

29195987,"Recently, a static in vitro digestion (IVD) protocol was published by Minekus and coworkers (Minekus et al., 2014) within the COST INFOGEST network. The protocol, concentrating on physiological enzyme activities had the main goal to improve the comparability of experimental data between labs. The protocol was validated in several inter-laboratory studies using skim milk powder (SMP) and indeed demonstrated improved harmonization compared with previous experiments with individual IVD protocols (Egger et al., 2016). Although the enzyme activities and salt concentrations of the harmonized protocol are based on available human in vivo data, confirmation of the protocol's physiological relevance has been lacking until now. The main goal of the study was therefore to compare the harmonized IVD protocol with data from in vivo digestion. Towards this aim, an in vivo pig experiment with the same SMP as used for the validation of the IVD protocol was performed followed by a comparison of protein hydrolysis between in vivo and in vitro results. Protein hydrolysis at different levels was analyzed with gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography, and spectrophotometric o-phthaldialdehyde determination of free amino acids. Principle component analysis was used for graphical data comparison. Milk proteins detected after gastric IVD corresponded to gastric and duodenal in vivo samples and intestinal IVD samples corresponded to distal jejunal in vivo samples. Peptides identified after the gastric phase of IVD, correlated with in vivo gastric samples (r=0.8) and intestinal IVD peptides correlated best with in vivo samples collected from the median jejunum (r=0.57). Free amino acids were in both systems mainly released during the intestinal phase of digestion. Protein hydrolysis in the harmonized IVD was similar to in vivo protein hydrolysis in pigs at the gastric and intestinal endpoints. Therefore, the harmonized static in vitro protocol is suited to study protein hydrolysis at these endpoints.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D000818', 'D004063', 'D004386', 'D057141', 'D005753', 'D006801', 'D006868', 'D066298', 'D007413', 'D007583', 'D008892', 'D008894', 'D015203', 'D013552']","['Animals', 'Digestion', 'Duodenum', 'Food, Preserved', 'Gastric Mucosa', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Jejunum', 'Milk', 'Milk Proteins', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Swine']",Physiological comparability of the harmonized INFOGEST in vitro digestion method to in vivo pig digestion.,"[None, 'Q000502', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378']","[None, 'physiology', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29195987,2019,0

Milk expressed at the beginning of feeding is known as foremilk and that at the end of feeding is known as hindmilk. As hindmilk contains higher fat, vitamins A and E, and higher calories than foremilk, feeding only hindmilk initially and reserving foremilk for later are practiced in some neonatal intensive care units. This study investigated the difference in peptide profiles, predicted milk protease activities, and bioactive peptides between foremilk and hindmilk. Bioactive peptides are short fragments of proteins that influence biological processes. Four mothers pumped 10 mL of their foremilk and 10 mL of their hindmilk into iced containers prepared with antiproteases and the samples were immediately frozen. The peptide profile of each sample was analyzed by liquid chromatography nano-electrospray ionization Orbitrap Fusion tandem mass spectrometry. Peptide abundance (sum of ion intensities) and count (number of unique peptide sequences) in each milk sample were determined from this analysis.

28958220,"Perchlorate (ClO4-) is an environmental pollutant that affects human health. Perchlorate acts as a competitive inhibitor of iodine uptake in the thyroid gland (sodium-iodide symporter inhibitor); thus, its determination is important for public health concerns. Water and milk constitute a significant portion of the human diet. Because regular intake leads to an increase in perchlorate concentration in the human body, the estimation of perchlorate is of great concern. In this work, ion-pair single-drop microextraction (SDME) combined with attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-FTIR spectroscopy has been developed for the determination of perchlorate in bioenvironmental (soil, water, dairy milk, breast milk, and urine) samples. Perchlorate was extracted in a single drop of methyl isobutyl ketone as an - with the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonuim bromide under optimized conditions. The strongest IR peak (at 1076 cm-1) was selected for the quantification of perchlorate among three observed vibrational peaks. Eight calibration curves for different concentration ranges of perchlorate were prepared, and excellent linearity was observed for absorbance and peak area in the range of 0.03-100 ng/mL perchlorate, with r values of 0.977 and 0.976, respectively. The RSDs (n = 8) for the perchlorate concentration ranges of 0.03-100, 0.03-0.5, 0.5-10, and 10-100 ng/mL were in the range of 1.9-2.7% for the above calibration curves. The LOD and LOQ in the present work were 0.003 and 0.02 ng/mL, respectively. The extracted microdrop was analyzed directly by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The parameters affecting SDME, i.e, effect of pH, stirring rate, reagent concentration, microdrop volume, and extraction time, were optimized, and the role of foreign species was also investigated. F- and t-tests were performed to check the analytical QA of the method. A noteworthy feature of the reported method is the noninterference of any of the associated ions. The results were compared with those of the ion chromatography MS method, and a high degree of acceptability was found.

28881314,"Human breast milk is the gold standard for infant feeding and the best possible nourishment a new-born could have. Breastfeeding is the natural way to provide optimal nutritional, immunological and emotional nurturing for the healthy growth and development of infants. Human milk is a complex and dynamic biofluid comprised of many hundreds to thousands of distinct bioactive structures, among which one of the most abundant substances are the non-conjugated complex carbohydrates referred to as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). Due to their structural diversity and abundance, HMOs possess many beneficial biological functions. In order to understand human milk composition and HMO functions, state-of-the-art glycomic methods are inevitable. The industrial, large scale chemoenzymatic production of the most abundant HMOs became a reality in the last years and it evokes the need for straightforward and genuine analytical procedures to monitor the synthetic process and the quality of the products. It is obvious, that HMOs represent the next breakthrough in infant nutrition, as the addition of HMOs (such as 2'-fucosyllactose or lacto-N-neotetraose) to infant- and follow-on formulas, processed cereal-based food and baby foods for infants and young children etc. will revolutionize this field. This review highlights the potential applications of HMOs in the (bio)pharmaceutical industry, also summarizes the analytical methods available for the characterization of HMOs.

This study focused on bioactive milk polar lipids (PLs) recovered from dietary sources that are of increasing interest. The chemical compositions of buttermilks and butter serums were determined and the modulation of the fatty acid composition of milk PLs was investigated. Butter serums contain a higher amount of milk PLs than buttermilks (88 vs. 13-18g/kg dry matter), with a higher proportion of sphingomyelin (34 vs. 19% of PLs, respectively) interestingly close to human milk PL profile. Butter serums are also interesting sources of choline, an important nutrient for infant brain development. We demonstrated that the unsaturated fatty acid content of milk PLs recovered in the buttermilks and the butter serums, mainly the amount of C18:3n-3 and C22:6n-3 (DHA) that are of nutritional interest, can be increased by dietary strategies.

28865855,"The aims of this work were (1) to develop prediction equations from mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) to establish a detailed fatty acid (FA) composition of milk; (2) to propose a milk FA index, utilizing MIRS-developed equations, in which the precision of the FA-prediction equations is taken into account to increase the value of milk; and (3) to show application examples. A total of 651 bulk cow milk samples were collected from 245 commercial farms in northwest Italy. The results of the 651 gas chromatography analyses were used to establish (421 samples) and to validate (230 samples) the outcomes of the FA composition prediction that had been obtained by MIRS. A class-based approach, in which the obtained MIRS equations were used, was proposed to define a milk classification. The method provides a numerical index [milk FA index (MFAI)] that allows a premium price to be quantified to increase the value of a favorable FA profile of milk. Ten FA were selected to calculate MFAI, according to their relevance for human health and potential cheese sensory properties, and animal welfare and environmental sustainability were also considered. These factors were selected as dimensions of MFAI. A statistical analysis and expert judgment aggregation were performed on the selected FA by weighting the FA and normalizing the dimensions to reduce redundancy. A class approach was applied, using the precision of the MIRS equations to establish the classes. The median FA concentration of the data set was set as a reference value of class 0. The width, number, and limits of classes above and below the median were calculated using the 95% confidence level of the standard error of prediction, corrected with the bias of each FA. A progressive number and a positive or negative sign were assigned to each FA class above or below the median according to their role in the above mentioned dimensions. The sum of the numbers of each class, associated with its sign for each FA, was used to generate MFAI. The MFAI was applied to dairy farms characterized by different feeding strategies, all of which deliver milk to a commercial dairy plant. The MFAI values ranged from 0.7 to 4.2, and large variations, which depended on the cows' diet and forage quality, were observed for each feeding system.

28737399,"Human breast milk (HBM) is a biofluid consisting of various biomolecules such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, minerals and bioactive substances. Due to its unique and complex composition, HBM provides not only nutritional components required for the growth of the infant, but also additional protection against infections. Global insight into the composition of HBM is crucial to understanding the health benefits infants receive from breastfeeding and could be used to improve the composition of milk formula for babies that cannot be breastfed. To improve global profiling of the HBM lipidome, a new analytical approach based on solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was developed. The new extraction method allows for the rapid and simple extraction of a broad range of lipids directly from HBM samples. Moreover, the optimized two-step lipid extraction protocol ensures high lipidome coverage without using toxic solvents such as chloroform. The use of liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS) and an automated search of a lipid database allows comprehensive identification of the lipids contained in HBM. The demonstrated analytical approach based on SPME sample preparation and LC-Q-TOF-MS is rapid, free of toxic solvents, and suited for the qualitative analysis of the HBM lipid composition.",Journal of proteome research,"['D002853', 'D005260', 'D055772', 'D006801', 'D008055', 'D008895', 'D052617', 'D012997', 'D019032']","['Chromatography, Liquid', 'Female', 'Green Chemistry Technology', 'Humans', 'Lipids', 'Milk, Human', 'Solid Phase Microextraction', 'Solvents', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",Rapid Characterization of the Human Breast Milk Lipidome Using a Solid-Phase Microextraction and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry-Based Approach.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000302', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None]","[None, None, None, None, 'isolation & purification', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28737399,2018,0
28726509,"Food allergies represent a serious problem affecting human health and soy proteins rank among the most allergenic proteins from food origin. The proteolytic enzymes produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can hydrolyse the major allergens present in soybean, reducing their immunoreactivity. Many studies have reported the ability of LAB to ferment soy-based products; while the majority of them focus on the improvement of the sensory characteristics and functionality of soy proteins, a lack of information about the role of lactic fermentation in the reduction of immunoreactivity of these proteins exists. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the capability of the proteolytic strain Enterococcus faecalis VB43 to hydrolyse the main allergenic proteins present in soymilk and to determine the immunoreactivity of the obtained hydrolysates. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) results of fermented soymilk demonstrated complete hydrolysis of the β-subunit from β-conglycinin and the acidic polypeptide from glycinin. Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) analysis of the peptides released after hydrolysis revealed the appearance of new peptides and the disappearance of non-hydrolysed proteins, indicating extensive hydrolysis of the substrate. Results from competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests clearly indicated a reduction in the immunoreactivity (more than one logarithmic unit) in the fermented sample as compared to the non-fermented control. Our results suggest that the soymilk fermented by E. faecalis VB43 may induce lower allergic responses in sensitive individuals.

Long ripening times allow for extensive proteolysis of milk proteins to yield a number of peptides, some of which have potential healthy bioactive properties. This study aimed to: i) determine the peptide profile of PR cheese subjected to simulated gastrointestinal transit; ii) evaluate in vitro whether the peptides could support growth of beneficial microbial groups of the gut microbiota. PR samples were subjected to in vitro digestion, simulating oral, gastric, and duodenal transit. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry revealed that digestion caused the disappearance of the serum proteins and most of the original peptides, while 71 new peptides were found, all ranging from 2 to 24 residues. The digests were given as sole nitrogen source to pure cultures of Bifidobacterium (27 strains) and Lactobacillus (30 strains), and to bioreactor batch cultures of human gut microbiota. Most of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli grew more abundantly on PR digests than on the control peptone, and exhibited strain- or species-specific peptide preferences, as evidenced by principal component analysis. Bifidobacteria generally consumed a greater amount of peptides than lactobacilli, in terms of both the mean peptide consumption and the number of peptides consumed. For bifidobacteria, peptide preferences were very diverse, but a core of 10 peptides with 4 or 5 residues were consumed by all the strains. Lactobacilli behaved more homogenously and consumed nearly only the same 6 peptides, mostly dipeptides. The peptide preferences of the different groups of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli could not be ascribed to features such as the length of the peptide or the abundance of residues with peculiar properties (hydrophobicity, polarity, charge) and likely depend on specific proteases and/or peptide transporters preferentially recognizing specific sequence motifs.

The developed method exploited magnetic solid phase extraction (SPE), a technique that is attracting an increasing interest as an alternative to classical SPE. Therefore, the use of magnetic graphitized carbon black as a suitable extracting material was tested. The same magnetic material proved to be effective in the extraction of mycoestrogens from milk, but has never been applied to complex matrices as cereals. Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used for detection. Recoveries were >60% in both cereals, even if the matrix effects were not negligible.

In order to assess the possible health effects of milk EV, it is essential to use isolates of high purity from other more abundant milk structures with well-documented bioactive properties. Furthermore, gentle isolation procedures are important for reducing the risk of generating vesicle artefacts, particularly when EV subpopulations are investigated. In this study, we present two isolation approaches accomplished in three steps based on size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) resulting in effective and reproducible EV isolation from raw milk. The approaches do not require any EV pelleting and can be applied to both human and bovine milk. We show that SEC effectively separates phospholipid membrane vesicles from the primary casein and whey protein components in two differently obtained casein reduced milk fractions, with one of the fractions obtained without the use of ultracentrifugation. Milk EV isolates were enriched in lactadherin, CD9, CD63 and CD81 compared to minimal levels of the EV-marker proteins in other relevant milk fractions such as milk fat globules. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and electron microscopy reveals the presence of heterogeneous sized vesicle structures in milk EV isolates. Lipid analysis by thin layer chromatography shows that EV isolates are devoid of triacylglycerides and presents a phospholipid profile differing from milk fat globules surrounded by epithelial cell plasma membrane. Moreover, the milk EV fractions are enriched in RNA with distinct and diverging profiles from milk fat globules. Collectively, our data supports that successful milk EV isolation can be accomplished in few steps without the use of ultracentrifugation, as the presented isolation approaches based on SEC effectively isolates EV in both human and bovine milk.",Journal of extracellular vesicles,[],[],Pellet-free isolation of human and bovine milk extracellular vesicles by size-exclusion chromatography.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28386391,2019,0

Differentially expressed whey proteins participated in many KEGG pathways, including major complement and coagulation cascades and in phagosomes. Whey proteins show obvious differences in expression in human and bovine colostrum and mature milk, with consequences for biological function. The results here increase our understanding of different whey proteomes, which could provide useful information for the development and manufacture of dairy products and nutrient food for infants.

To achieve the maximum residue limits, the most discussed method of high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) is widely used with a advantage of high precision and resolution. Prothioconazole is a broad-spectrum thiocarbamate fungicide. It can rapidly metabolize to prothioconazole-desthio in different matrixes. Rapid and effective methods for the determination of prothioconazole-desthio in five kinds of different animal food were developed. Samples were extracted with acetonitrile or acetonitrile/water and determined by HPLC-MS/MS. The limit of detection and limit of quantification values of prothioconazole-desthio were 0.015 and 0.05 mg/kg for porcine liver and kidney, 0.0015 and 0.005 mg/kg for pork, and 0.003 and 0.01 mg/kg for eggs, together with 0.0012 and 0.004 mg/kg for milk of the detected method, respectively.

Its composition varies according to milk origin (e.g., species and breed), rearing conditions (e.g., feeding and management), and cheese-making technology (e.g., coagulation process, addition of salt, ripening period). In recent years, cheese production has increased worldwide. Italy is one of the main producers and exporters of cheese. This study aimed to describe mineral, FA, and cholesterol content of 133 samples from 18 commercial cheeses from 4 dairy species (buffalo, cow, goat, and sheep) and from 3 classes of moisture content (hard, <35% moisture; semi-hard, 35-45%; and soft, >45%). Mineral concentrations of cheese samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, and FA and cholesterol contents were determined by gas chromatography. Moisture and species had a significant effect on almost all traits: the highest levels of Na, Ca, and Fe were found in cheeses made from sheep milk; the greatest level of Cu was found in cow milk cheese, the lowest amount of K was found in buffalo milk cheese, and the lowest amount of Zn was found in goat cheeses. In all samples, Cr and Pb were not detected (below the level of detection). In general, total fat, protein, and minerals significantly increased when the moisture decreased. Buffalo and goat cheeses had the highest saturated FA content, and sheep cheeses showed the highest content of unsaturated and polyunsaturated FA, conjugated linoleic acid, and n-3 FA. Goat and sheep cheeses achieved higher proportions of minor FA than did cow and buffalo cheeses. Buffalo cheese exhibited the lowest cholesterol level.

The aim of our study was the biological monitoring of exposure to eight phthalate metabolites in children (n=107), 10-12 years of age, living in eastern Slovakia. Additionally, we analysed some associations between anthropometric measures, questionnaire data (i.e. eating and drinking habits, practice of personal care products) and concentrations of phthalate metabolites. Because of the short half-life of phthalates, within 24-48 h, we used 24-h recalls to assess dietary intakes.

Although OTA was not detected in any of the infant formula samples, 47 (30%) of 155 infant cereals were contaminated with OTA in the range of 0.6 to 22.1 ng/g. At present, there is no regulatory limit for OTA in the United States. However, all of the positive samples were above the maximum level set by the European Commission (0.5 ng/g) for OTA in baby foods. OTA was detected in all types of infant cereals, but the highest incidence and concentrations were found in oat-based infant cereals (59%), followed by mixed grain cereals (34%).

The objectives of the present study were (1) to characterize the fatty acid composition of Mediterranean buffalo milk, and (2) to investigate potential sources of variation in the buffalo milk fatty acid profile. We determined the profile of 69 fatty acid traits in 272 individual samples of Mediterranean buffalo milk using gas chromatography. In total, 51 individual fatty acids were identified: 24 saturated fatty acids, 13 monounsaturated fatty acids, and 14 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The major individual fatty acids in buffalo milk were in the order 16:0, 18:1 cis-9, 14:0, and 18:0. Saturated fatty acids were the predominant fraction in buffalo milk fat (70.49%); monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids were at 25.95 and 3.54%, respectively. Adopting a classification based on carbon-chain length, we found that medium-chain fatty acids (11-16 carbons) represented the greater part (53.7%) of the fatty acid fraction of buffalo milk, whereas long-chain fatty acids (17-24 carbons) and short-chain fatty acids (4-10 carbons) accounted for 32.73 and 9.72%, respectively. The n-3 and n-6 fatty acids were 0.46 and 1.77%, respectively. The main conjugated linoleic acid, rumenic acid, represented 0.45% of total milk fatty acids. Herd/test date and stage of lactation were confirmed as important sources of variation in the fatty acid profile of buffalo milk. The percentages of short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids in buffalo milk increased in early lactation (+0.6 and +3.5%, respectively), whereas long-chain fatty acids decreased (-4.2%). The only exception to this pattern was butyric acid, which linearly decreased from the beginning of lactation, confirmation that its synthesis is independent of malonyl-CoA. These results seem to suggest that in early lactation the mobilization of energy reserves may have less influence on the fatty acid profile of buffalo milk than that of cow milk, probably due to a shorter and less severe period of negative energy balance. Parity affected the profiles of a few traits and had the most significant effects on branched-chain fatty acids. This work provided a detailed overview of the fatty acid profile in buffalo milk including also those fatty acids present in small concentrations, which may have beneficial effects for human health.

Recent studies have shown that Maya communities have a poor perception about the proper usage and handling of OCP. The karstic soil in this area has a high vulnerability to groundwater pollution by the use of OCP in agriculture and livestock activities. The impact of the ecosystem on human health is much more critical due to the prevailing poverty and a very low educational level of these communities. About 30% of the Maya population consumes water directly from contaminated wells and sinkholes, resulting in a chronic exposure to OCP. The samples served to identify and quantify high levels of OCP residues (18.43 mg/kg of heptachlor epoxide and 1.92 mg/kg of endrin in the metropolitan zone; 2.10 mg/kg of dieldrin, 0.117 mg/kg of endosulfan II, 0.103 mg/kg of heptachlor, 0.178 mg/kg of endrin, and 0.127 mg/kg of endrin aldehyde in the main agricultural zone and on the west coast). The detected levels of OCP residues are a major concern and represent a potential risk to women and children in the region. This could be associated with the high rates of cervical uterine and breast cancer mortality in Yucatan.

Accordingly, the aim of this study was to investigate potential garlic-derived metabolites in human urine. To this aim, 14 sets of urine samples were obtained from 12 volunteers, whereby each set comprised one sample that was collected prior to consumption of food-relevant concentrations of garlic, followed by five to eight subsequent samples after garlic consumption that covered a time interval of up to 26 h. The samples were analyzed chemo-analytically using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry (GC-MS/O), as well as sensorially by a trained human panel. The analyses revealed three different garlic-derived metabolites in urine, namely allyl methyl sulfide (AMS), allyl methyl sulfoxide (AMSO) and allyl methyl sulfone (AMSO₂), confirming our previous findings on human milk metabolite composition. The excretion rates of these metabolites into urine were strongly time-dependent with distinct inter-individual differences.

Milk samples were collected 3 days after delivery (colostrum) and in the third month postpartum (mature milk) by hand expression. The fatty acid composition of the milk samples was determined by gas chromatography. TFA intake corresponded to 1.23 % of total energy value. Total 18:2 TFA accounted for less than 0.5 % of the energy intake. The amount of total 18:1 TFA (mean ± SEM) was 1.9 % ± 0.14 in colostrum and 1.5 % ± 0.2 in mature milk. The total content of n-3 PUFA was inversely correlated with the total content of 18:1 TFA in colostrum. Both in colostrum and in mature milk, vaccenic acid (11t-18:1) was found to be the most abundant 18:1 trans isomer, followed by elaidic acid (9t-18:1), whereas rumenic acid (9c,11t-18:2 CLA) was the predominant 18:2 trans isomer. In conclusion, the levels of TFA of industrial sources found in the mother's diet and breast milk (colostrum and mature milk) showed a decrease in relation to those observed in studies conducted prior to the TFA labeling resolution in Brazil. However, the current low intake levels of n-3 LCPUFA and DHA content in the milk of lactating adolescents may be insufficient for supporting adequate neurological development of the infants.",Lipids,"['D000293', 'D001938', 'D001942', 'D002849', 'D003126', 'D003430', 'D015525', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D044243', 'D008895', 'D019301', 'D009829', 'D011247', 'D044242', 'D055815']","['Adolescent', 'Brazil', 'Breast Feeding', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Colostrum', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-3', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Linoleic Acids, Conjugated', 'Milk, Human', 'Oleic Acid', 'Oleic Acids', 'Pregnancy', 'Trans Fatty Acids', 'Young Adult']","trans Fatty Acids in Colostrum, Mature Milk and Diet of Lactating Adolescents.","[None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27830423,2017,0

The aim of this work was to analyze the protein fractions from canary seed flour and from milk substitutes (prepared by soaking the seeds in water 12 and 24 h), and to evaluate antioxidant and antihypertensive capacity of peptides obtained after in vitro digestion. Prolamins were the major protein fraction, followed by glutelins. After digestion, albumins and prolamins fractions from milks presented higher levels of peptides than flour, globulins showed more peptides in flour and glutelins were found in similar concentrations in all samples; 24 h milk prolamins had the highest concentration of peptides. Purification by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), sequencing of peptides, in vitro antioxidant ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis, 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assays, and antihypertensive capacity (angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) assay), indicated that peptides from canary seed prolamins were the most efficient compounds with antioxidant and antihypertensive activity.

27601599,"Breast milk contains several macromolecular components with distinctive functions, whereby milk fat globules and casein micelles mainly provide nutrition to the newborn, and whey contains molecules that can stimulate the newborn's developing immune system and gastrointestinal tract. Although extracellular vesicles (EV) have been identified in breast milk, their physiological function and composition has not been addressed in detail. EV are submicron sized vehicles released by cells for intercellular communication via selectively incorporated lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins. Because of the difficulty in separating EV from other milk components, an in-depth analysis of the proteome of human milk-derived EV is lacking. In this study, an extensive LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis was performed of EV that had been purified from breast milk of seven individual donors using a recently established, optimized density-gradient-based EV isolation protocol. A total of 1963 proteins were identified in milk-derived EV, including EV-associated proteins like CD9, Annexin A5, and Flotillin-1, with a remarkable overlap between the different donors. Interestingly, 198 of the identified proteins are not present in the human EV database Vesiclepedia, indicating that milk-derived EV harbor proteins not yet identified in EV of different origin. Similarly, the proteome of milk-derived EV was compared with that of other milk components. For this, data from 38 published milk proteomic studies were combined in order to construct the total milk proteome, which consists of 2698 unique proteins. Remarkably, 633 proteins identified in milk-derived EV have not yet been identified in human milk to date. Interestingly, these novel proteins include proteins involved in regulation of cell growth and controlling inflammatory signaling pathways, suggesting that milk-derived EVs could support the newborn's developing gastrointestinal tract and immune system.

In the event that a mother of a hospitalized infant cannot provide breast milk, donor milk is considered an acceptable alternative. It is known that the macronutrient composition of donor milk is different than human milk, with variable fat content and protein content. However, much less is known about the micronutrient content of donor milk, including nutritional antioxidants. Samples of breast milk from 12 mothers of infants hospitalized in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit until were collected and analyzed for concentrations of nutritional antioxidants, including α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, lutein + zeaxanthin, retinol, and α-tocopherol. Additionally, a homogenized sample of donor milk available from a commercial milk bank and samples of infant formulas were also analyzed. Concentrations of nutritional antioxidants were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Compared to breast milk collected from mothers of hospitalized infants, commercially available donor milk had 18%-53% of the nutritional antioxidant content of maternal breast milk.

The present work reports the results of an in-depth characterization of SM whey proteome, carried out by coupling the CPLL technology with SDS-PAGE and high resolution UPLC-nESI MS/MS analysis. This approach allowed the identification of 718 different protein components, 644 of which are from unique genes. Particularly, this identification has expanded literature data about sheep whey proteome by 193 novel proteins previously undetected, many of which are involved in the defence/immunity mechanisms or in the nutrient delivery system. A comparative analysis of SM proteome known to date with cow's milk proteome, evidenced that while about 29% of SM proteins are also present in CM, 71% of the identified components appear to be unique of SM proteome and include a heterogeneous group of components which seem to have health-promoting benefits.

27749892,"Cow's milk is an important source of proteins in human nutrition. On average, cow's milk contains 3.5% protein. The most abundant proteins in bovine milk are caseins and some of the whey proteins, namely beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-lactalbumin, and serum albumin. A number of allelic variants and post-translationally modified forms of these proteins have been identified. Their occurrence varies with breed, individuality, stage of lactation, and health and nutritional status of the animal. It is therefore essential to have reliable methods of detection and quantitation of these proteins. Traditionally, major milk proteins are quantified using liquid chromatography (LC) and ultra violet detection method. However, as these protein variants co-elute to some degree, another dimension of separation is beneficial to accurately measure their amounts. Mass spectrometry (MS) offers such a tool. In this study, we tested several RP-HPLC and MS parameters to optimise the analysis of intact bovine proteins from milk. From our tests, we developed an optimum method that includes a 20-28-40% phase B gradient with 0.02% TFA in both mobile phases, at 0.2 mL/min flow rate, using 75°C for the C8 column temperature, scanning every 3 sec over a 600-3000 m/z window. The optimisations were performed using external standards commercially purchased for which ionisation efficiency, linearity of calibration, LOD, LOQ, sensitivity, selectivity, precision, reproducibility, and mass accuracy were demonstrated. From the MS analysis, we can use extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) of specific ion series of known proteins and integrate peaks at defined retention time (RT) window for quantitation purposes.

Because of this, rapid-throughput methods are desired to investigate biological activity in large patient sets. We have optimized a rapid-throughput protocol to analyze human milk oligosaccharides using micro-volumes of human breast milk for nutritional biomarkers. This method may additionally be applied to other biological fluid substrates such as plasma, urine, and feces. The protocol involves lipid separation via centrifugation, protein precipitation using ethanol, alditol reduction with sodium borohydride, and a final solid-phase extraction purification step using graphitized carbon cartridges. Samples are analyzed using HPLC-Chip/TOF-MS and data filtered on Agilent MassHunter using an in-house library.

The results showed that, only pp'DDE and p,pDDD, were found in 82.5% and 70% of analyzed samples respectively, the total DDT were at level of 0.37, 0.32, 0.30 and 0.46 μg/L in the four cities respectively and were far below the MRL of 50 μg/L (FAO/WHO). The estimated daily intake (EDI) of DDT ingested by infant weight 3.5 kg ranged between 0.06 and 0.10 μg/kg, which is less than the ADI issued by (EFSA, 2014). Lindane (γ-HCH) found in 91.25% of the analyzed samples at level of 0.37, 0.35, 0.35 and 0.29 μg/L. The EDIs of Lindane by infant were far below the ADI of 5 μg/kg bw/day. Dieldrin and Enderin were found in 27.5% and 58.8% of samples respectively and were lower than MRL issued by FAO/WHO, but the (EDI) was higher than the ADI issued by EFSA. The isomer A-heptachlor was detected in 51% of the samples, at levels were 15 times lower than the MRL issued by FAO/WHO, but EDIs by infants were 2-4 times higher than the ADI issued by EFSA.

The aim of this study was to develop a goat milk protein hydrolysate (GMPH) with enhanced digestibility and better hypoallergenic properties in comparison with other protein sources such as ovalbumin and soy protein. Goat milk protein was digested with four commercial food-grade proteases (separately) under various conditions to achieve the best hydrolysis of αs -casein and β-lactoglobulin. It was shown that treatment with alcalase (0.4%, 60℃ for 30 min) effectively degraded these two proteins, as determined by SDS-PAGE, measurement of nonprotein nitrogen content, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Hydrolysis with alcalase resulted in a significant decrease in β-lactoglobulin concentration (almost to nil) and a ~40% reduction in the level of αs-casein. Quantification of histamine and TNF-α released from HMC-1 cells (human mast cell line) showed that the GMPH did not induce an allergic response when compared to the control. Hence, the GMPH may be useful for development of novel foods for infants, the elderly, and convalescent patients, to replace cow milk.

While macrosomic infants have a higher risk of developing obesity and other metabolic disorders. Breast milk may contain special nutrients to meet the different growth needs of different infants. Whether mothers make breast milk different to meet the requirement of macrosomic infants is still unknown. Here, we conducted a comparison between mothers delivering macrosomic and non-macrosomic infants in colostrum endogenous peptides. More than 400 peptides, originating from at least 34 protein precursors, were identified by Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS). Out of these, 29 peptides found to be significant differently expressed (|fold change| ≥ 3, P < 0.01). Blastp analysis revealed 41 peptides may have established biological activities, which exhibit immunomodulating, antibacterial action, antioxidation, opioid agonist and antihypertensive activity. Furthermore, we found that peptide located at β-Casein 24-38 AA has antimicrobial effect against E. coli, Y. enterocolitica and S. aureus. While, κ-Casein 89-109 AA-derived peptide plays as a regulator of preadipocyte proliferation. The profile of endogenous peptides from macrosomic term infants is different from non-macrosomic terms.

However, food contaminants such as mycotoxins, which may be transferred from maternal blood to milk, are poorly described. Mycotoxins are a major group of natural toxins frequently detected in foods. Here, we review the current state-of-the-art in the monitoring of mycotoxins in human breast milk, i.e., knowledge on occurrence, metabolism, and analytical assays utilized for their quantification. We highlight that most of the data captured to date have not been verified with the precision now capable utilizing LC-MS/MS and LC-HRMS approaches. One concern is that some studies may overestimate individual measures, and most cannot capture the patterns and levels of mycotoxin mixtures. We propose accurate assessment as a priority, especially for aflatoxins, fumonisins, ochratoxin A, zearalenone, and deoxynivalenol as well as their major metabolites. However, also so-called emerging toxins such as citrinin, the enniatins, beauvericin, aurofusarin, or Alternaria toxins should be considered to evaluate their potential relevance. Key requirements for analytical quality assurance are identified and discussed to guide future developments in this area. Moreover, research needs including investigations of lactational transfer rates, the role of human metabolism for bioactivation or detoxification, and an evaluation of potential combinatory effects of different mycotoxins are pointed out.

Sensory evaluation revealed a clear garlic/cabbage-like odor that appeared in breast milk about 2.5 h after consumption of garlic.

Of these, only AMS had a garlic-like odor whereas the other two metabolites were odorless. This demonstrates that the odor change in human milk is not related to a direct transfer of garlic odorants, as is currently believed, but rather derives from a single metabolite. The formation of these metabolites is not fully understood, but AMSO and AMSO₂ are most likely formed by the oxidation of AMS in the human body.

Considerable variations in the amounts of the individual MRPs were found, most likely as a consequence of the nutritional uptake of glycated proteins. When comparing commercial milk samples labeled as originating from ""organic"" or ""conventional"" farming, respectively, significant differences in the content of free PYR (organic milk, 20-300 pmol/mL; conventional milk, 400-1000 pmol/mL) were observed. An analysis of feed samples indicated that rapeseed and sugar beet are the main sources for MRPs in conventional farming. Furthermore, milk of different dairy animals (cow, buffalo, donkey, goat, ewe, mare, camel) as well as for the first time human milk was analyzed for free MRPs. The distribution of their concentrations, with FL and PYR as the most abundant in human milk and with a high individual variability, also points to a nutritional influence. As the components of concentrated feed do not belong to the natural food sources of ruminants and equidae, free MRPs in milk might serve as indicators for an adequate animal feeding in near-natural farming and can be suitable parameters to distinguish between an ""organic"" and ""conventional"" production method of milk.

27213448,"We aimed to assess the correlation between docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) dietary intake and the plasma, erythrocyte and breast milk DHA concentrations in lactating women residing in the coastland, lakeland and inland areas of China. A total of 408 healthy lactating women (42 ± 7 days postpartum) were recruited from four hospitals located in Weihai (coastland), Yueyang (lakeland) and Baotou (inland) city. The categories of food containing DHA, the average amount consumed per time and the frequency of consumption in the past month were assessed by a tailored DHA food frequency questionnaire, the DHA Intake Evaluation Tool (DIET). DHA dietary intake (mg/day) was calculated according to the Chinese Food Composition Table (Version 2009). In addition, fasting venous blood (5 mL) and breast milk (10 mL) were collected from lactating women. DHA concentrations in plasma, erythrocyte and breast milk were measured using capillary gas chromatography, and were reported as absolute concentration (μg/mL) and relative concentration (weight percent of total fatty acids, wt. %). Spearman correlation coefficients were used to assess the correlation between intakes of DHA and its concentrations in biological specimens. The study showed that the breast milk, plasma and erythrocyte DHA concentrations were positively correlated with DHA dietary intake; corresponding correlation coefficients were 0.36, 0.36 and 0.24 for relative concentration and 0.33, 0.32, and 0.18 for absolute concentration (p < 0.05). The median DHA dietary intake varied significantly across areas (p < 0.05), which was highest in the coastland (24.32 mg/day), followed by lakeland (13.69 mg/day), and lowest in the inland (8.84 mg/day). The overall relative and absolute DHA concentrations in breast milk were 0.36% ± 0.23% and 141.49 ± 107.41 μg/mL; the concentrations were significantly lower in inland women than those from coastland and lakeland. We conclude that DHA dietary intake is positively correlated with DHA concentrations in blood and breast milk in Chinese lactating women, suggesting that the tailored DHA food frequency questionnaire, DIET, is a valid tool for the assessment of DHA dietary intake.

These differentially expressed proteins were analyzed based on multivariate analysis, gene ontology (GO) annotation and KEGG pathway. Biological processes involved were response to stimulus, localization, establishment of localization, and the immune system process. Cellular components engaged were the extracellular space, extracellular region parts, cell fractions, and vesicles. Molecular functions touched upon were protein binding, nucleotide binding, and enzyme inhibitor activity. The KEGG pathway analysis showed several pathways, including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion, neurotrophin signaling pathway, leukocyte transendothelial migration, tight junction, complement and coagulation cascades, vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway, and adherens junction.

The first objective was to assess human exposure to AFs among Haitians at an urban hospital (GHESKIO) and a rural health centre (HCBH). The second objective was to test the association between AF exposure and reported dietary intake of potentially contaminated foods, such as maize, peanut products and milk. Measurement of urinary AFM1 by HPLC revealed that among 367 participants 14% and 22% at GHESKIO and HCBH, respectively, had detectable AFM1. The maximum and median AFM1 concentrations for all detected samples were 700 pg AFM1 ml(-1) and 11.7 pg ml(-1), respectively. Detection of AFM1 was significantly associated with peanut consumption (p < 0.05). Controlling for diet and age group in a logit model, patients who reported peanut consumption the day of the survey and patients from HCBH had greater log odds of excreting detectable AFM1 (p < 0.001 and 0.002, respectively); females had lower log odds (p = 0.020).

In the presented study, we have introduced the new analytical approach for analysis of 24 highly occurring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in this indicator matrix. The sample preparation procedure is based on an ethyl acetate extraction of milk; the transfer of analytes into an organic layer is enhanced by addition of inorganic salts, i.e. sodium chloride and magnesium sulphate. Following the clean-up of a crude extract on silica SPE columns, gas chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry is used for PAH identification and quantitation. The average recoveries of targeted PAHs from spiked samples were in the range of 68-110% with repeatabilities below 30% and method quantitation limits ranging from 0.03 to 0.3ng/g lipid weight. This newly validated method was successfully applied for analyses of 324 human milk samples collected from nonsmoking women during two sampling periods (summer and winter) in two residential areas in the Czech Republic differing in atmospheric pollution by PAHs. From 24 targeted analytes 17 were detected at least in one sample.

Comparing the data from two sampling periods, in both areas higher concentrations were measured in samples collected during winter. Also in the highly industrialized locality with heavily contaminated air PAH amounts in milk were higher than in the control locality.

27052471,"The thermal stability of antibiotics commonly detected in food is reviewed. To quantify degradation, 2 major techniques have been reported: liquid chromatography-based methods and microbiological tests. As the degradation products may also display some antimicrobial activity, microbiological tests may not be considered accurate analytical methods for quantifying antibiotic residues' degradation. Degradation percentages are summarized for different antibiotics and for various media (water, oil, milk, and animal tissues). Studies presented in the literature confirm that the thermal degradation of β-lactams, quinolones, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines can be described using a first-order kinetic model. Degradation rates, k, derived for this model for liquid matrix (water) at 100 °C, followed the general trend amongst antibiotic classes: β-lactams = tetracyclines (most heat-labile) > lincomycin > amphenicols > sulfonamides > oxfendazole > levamisole (most heat-stable). Although thermal processing results in a decrease in the concentration of parent antibiotic residues, degradation by-products have not been properly characterized to date. As some of these products were shown to be hazardous, further investigation is needed to determine their impact on food safety and human health.

Magnetic ethylendiamine-functionalized graphene oxide nanocomposite was synthesized and used as a novel adsorbent for the microextraction process and showed great adsorptive ability toward these analytes. Different parameters affecting the microextraction were optimized with the aid of the experimental design approach. A Plackett-Burman screening design was used to study the main variables affecting the microextraction process, and the Box-Behnken optimization design was used to optimize the previously selected variables for extraction of naproxen and ibuprofen. The optimized technique provides good repeatability (relative standard deviations of the intraday precision 3.1 and 3.3, interday precision of 5.6 and 6.1%), linearity (0.1-500 and 0.3-650 ng/mL), low limits of detection (0.03 and 0.1 ng/mL), and a high enrichment factor (168 and 146) for naproxen and ibuprofen, respectively.

Understanding whether this further impacts the kinetics of peptide release during gastrointestinal digestion of human milk was the aim of the present paper. Mature raw (RHM) or pasteurized (PHM) human milk were digested (RHM, n = 2; PHM, n = 3) by an in vitro dynamic system (term stage). Label-free quantitative peptidomics was performed on milk and digesta (ten time points). Ascending hierarchical clustering was conducted on ""Pasteurization × Digestion time"" interaction coefficients. Preproteolysis occurred in human milk (159 unique peptides; RHM: 91, PHM: 151), mostly on β-casein (88% of the endogenous peptides). The predicted cleavage number increased with pasteurization, potentially through plasmin activation (plasmin cleavages: RHM, 53; PHM, 76). During digestion, eight clusters resumed 1054 peptides from RHM and PHM, originating for 49% of them from β-casein. For seven clusters (57% of peptides), the kinetics of peptide release differed between RHM and PHM. The parent protein was significantly linked to the clustering (p-value = 1.4 E-09), with β-casein and lactoferrin associated to clusters in an opposite manner.

We aim to determine α-tocopherol and retinol contents in breast milk obtained over the course of lactation stages from mothers in three regions in China, and to investigate their correlation with maternal dietary intake during lactation. Human milk samples and 24 hour food records were obtained from mothers in Hangzhou (n = 34), Lanzhou (n = 34) and Beijing (n = 34) on day 1 (colostrum), day 14 (transitional milk) and day 42 (mature milk) postpartum. Concentrations of α-tocopherol and retinol in breast milk samples were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The breast milk concentrations of α-tocopherol and retinol decreased over progress of lactation stages (P < 0.001). The retinol content of transitional milk from Hangzhou was higher than that in Lanzhou (P = 0.019) and Beijing (P < 0.001), and the α-tocopherol content in colostrum from Hangzhou showed a lower concentration than that from Lanzhou (P = 0.001).

This study was designed to measure the GHB endogenous levels in blood and breast milk of 20 breastfeeding women. In addition, blood and breast milk samples of a 32-year-old narcoleptic nursing mother, who was on sodium oxybate treatment, were simultaneously collected at 0.5, 1, 3, 4 and 5h following a 4.5g GHB dose and analyzed, in order to establish the safety interval of time to breastfeed. A GC-MS method for the detection and quantification of GHB in blood and breast milk was developed and fully validated. The geometric mean of endogenous GHB levels in blood and breast milk detected at time 0 were 0.57mg/L; 95% Reference Interval (RI): 0.21-1.52mg/L and 0.36mg/L; 95% RI: 0.13-1.03mg/L, respectively. The geometric mean of the concentration of GHB in milk was 37% less (95% RI: from 14 to 53%) compared to that found in the blood. The analysis of blood and breast milk samples collected from the 32 years-old female showed the following results: GHB blood concentration 0.5h after medication intake was 80.10mg/L, reaching the peak 1h after the drug administration (108.34mg/L) and it steadily decreased to reach a level of 1.75mg/L, 5h after the medication intake. The GHB concentration found in breast milk followed the same pattern as for the blood, with the highest concentration being 23.19mg/L, 1h after sodium oxybate administration and the lowest 0.99mg/L, 5h after the medication's intake. The comparison between blood and breast milk GHB levels in the 32-year-old woman, showed significant lower GHB levels in milk at 0.5, 1 and 3h, ranging from 71 to 80% less. It is interesting to note that only at 4 and 5h the difference between blood and breast milk GHB levels fell within the 95% RI (14-53%) of endogenous levels. Taking into consideration the absence of reference values for endogenous GHB in milk, we suggest the following reference interval: 0.13-1.03mg/L. We would recommend, following these preliminary data, that nursing mothers under sodium oxybate treatment should breastfeed at least 5h after the last GHB administration.

The main component in milk oligosaccharides is free oligosaccharides. Since the proteins in milk are highly glycosylated, N-glycans in milk also play an import role. In this study, we investigated the permethylated free oligosaccharides and N-glycans extracted from bovine, goat, and human milks using LC-MS/MS. Quantitation profiles of free oligosaccharides and N-glycans were reported. The number of free oligosaccharides observed in bovine, goat, and human milk samples (without isomeric consideration) were 11, 8, and 11, respectively. Human milk had more complex free oligosaccharides structures than the other two milk samples. Totally 58, 21, and 43 N-glycan structures (without isomeric consideration) were associated with whey proteins extracted from bovine, goat, and human milk samples, respectively. Bovine milk free oligosaccharides and N-glycans from whey proteins were highly sialylated and to a lesser extend fucosylated. Goat and human milk free oligosaccharides and N-glycans from whey proteins were both highly fucosylated. Also, the isomeric glycans in milk samples were determined by porous graphitic carbon LC at elevated temperatures. For example, separation of human milk free oligosaccharide Gal-GlcNAc-(Fuc)-Gal-Glc and Gal-GlcNAc-Gal-Glc-Fuc isomers was achieved using porous graphitic carbon column. Permethylation of the glycan structures facilitated the interpretation of MS/MS.

26910555,"Mozzarella di Bufala Campana is a soft, stretched curd Italian cheese made from fresh buffalo milk that obtained the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) registration in EU legislation. Seasonality of buffalo milk production, rapid cheese decay and transport of its preserving liquid have relevant practical/economic consequences for mozzarella production; consequently, a progressive diffusion of cheese products realized with frozen curd or frozen milk has recently been observed. In order to meet the demand of the dairy producers and consumers for a reduction of starting material adulterations and for the certification of the raw milk used for cheese manufacturing, we have developed a rapid/robust MALDI-TOF-MS polypeptide profiling procedure that assays material quality through the identification of specific markers of its freshness. Massive analysis of fresh and frozen buffalo milks (stored for different times) was realized to this purpose; a tough statistical evaluation of the resulting data ultimately permitted the typing of milk samples. We identified 28 polypeptide markers of the milk freezing storage, among which 13 and 15 showed down- and over-representation, respectively. Quantitative data were confirmed by an independent analytical approach on selected markers. GLYCAM1-derived phosphopeptides (1-53), β-casein-derived phosphopeptides (1-68), β-casein-derived γ2-, γ3- and γ4-fragments, α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin were components showing the highest significance. The occurrence of the first compounds in buffalo milk is here described for the first time; their formation in the frozen material was ascribed to the activity of plasmin or of unknown bacterial proteases/peptidases stable at low temperatures.

Rats were fed for 1 week semisynthetic diets that differed only regarding protein source; casein (reference) was fully replaced by isolated soy, chicken, fish, or pork protein. Changes in liver proteome were measured by iTRAQ labeling and LC-ESI-MS/MS. A robust set totaling 1437 unique proteins was identified and subjected to differential protein analysis and biological interpretation. Compared with casein, all other protein sources reduced the abundance of proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism and Pparα signaling pathway. All dietary proteins, except chicken, increased oxidoreductive transformation reactions but reduced energy and essential amino acid metabolic pathways. Only soy protein increased the metabolism of sulfur-containing and nonessential amino acids. Soy and fish proteins increased translation and mRNA processing, whereas only chicken protein increased TCA cycle but reduced immune responses.

The O-linked glycans of tear mucins have long been considered to play a role in binding to pathogens and facilitating their removal in the tear flow. Other conjugated glycans in tears could similarly contribute to pathogen binding and removal but have received less attention. In the work presented here we assessed the contribution of glycan moieties, in particular the protein attached N-glycans, presented by the broad complement of tear proteins to the adhesion of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a leading cause of microbial keratitis and ulceration of the cornea. Our adhesion assay involved immobilising the macromolecular components of tears into the wells of a polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) microtitre filter plate and probing the binding of fluorescently labelled bacteria. Three P. aeruginosa strains were studied: a cytotoxic strain (6206) and an invasive strain (6294) from eye infections, and an invasive strain (320) from a urinary tract infection (UTI). The ocular isolates adhered two to three times more to human tears than to human saliva or porcine gastric mucin, suggesting ocular niche-specific adaptation. Support for the role of the N-glycans carried by human tear proteins in the binding and removal of P. aeruginosa from the eye was shown by: 1) pre-incubation of the bacteria with free component sugars, galactose, mannose, fucose and sialyl lactose (or combination thereof) inhibiting adhesion of all the P. aeruginosa strains to the immobilised tear proteins, with the greatest inhibition of binding of the ocular cytotoxic 6206 and least for the invasive 6294 strain; 2) pre-incubation of the bacteria with N-glycans released from the commercially available human milk lactoferrin, an abundant protein that carries N-linked glycans in tears, inhibiting the adhesion to tears of the ocular bacteria by up to 70%, which was significantly more binding inhibition than by the same amount of intact human lactoferrin or by the plant-derived N-glycans released from the rice recombinant lactoferrin; 3) pre-incubation of the bacteria with N-linked glycans released from human tear proteins inhibiting the adhesion of the ocular P. aeruginosa strains to immobilised tear proteins; 4) inhibition by the N-glycans from lactoferrin of the ability of an ocular strain of P. aeruginosa to invade corneal epithelial cells; 5) removal of terminal sialic acid and fucose moieties from the tear glycoproteins with α2-3,6,8 neuraminidase (sialidase) and α1-2,3,4 fucosidase resulting in a reduction in binding of the UTI P. aeruginosa isolate, but not the adhesion of the ocular cytotoxic (6206) or invasive (6294) isolates. Glycosidase activity was validated by mass spectrometry. In all cases, the magnitude of inhibition of bacterial adhesion by the N-glycans was consistently greater for the cytotoxic ocular strain than for the invasive ocular strain. Ocular P. aeruginosa isolates seems to exhibit different adhesion mechanism than previously known PAI and PAII lectin adhesion. The work may contribute towards the development of glycan-focused therapies to prevent P. aeruginosa infection of the eye.",Experimental eye research,"['D000704', 'D000818', 'D001422', 'D003315', 'D004847', 'D019573', 'D015818', 'D005136', 'D006023', 'D006801', 'D007634', 'D007781', 'D037102', 'D009077', 'D011134', 'D011550', 'D013552', 'D013666']","['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Adhesion', 'Cornea', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium, Corneal', 'Eye Infections, Bacterial', 'Eye Proteins', 'Glycoproteins', 'Humans', 'Keratitis', 'Lactoferrin', 'Lectins', 'Mucins', 'Polysaccharides', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Swine', 'Tears']",Glycan involvement in the adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to tears.,"[None, None, 'Q000502', 'Q000382', 'Q000382', 'Q000382', 'Q000382', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000472', None, 'Q000378']","[None, None, 'physiology', 'microbiology', 'microbiology', 'microbiology', 'microbiology', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'pathogenicity', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26851486,2017,0

The analytes were separated on an XBridge™ hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) column using 10mM ammonium formate in ultrapure water and acetonitrile. Good linearity was achieved over the tested concentrations in matrix-fortified calibrations with correlation coefficients (R(2))≥0.9686. Recovery at two spiking levels ranged between 73.62-112.70% with intra- and inter-day precisions of ≤20.33%. The limits of quantification ranged from 2-10ng/g in porcine muscle and pasteurized cow milk. A survey of market samples showed that none of them contained any of the target analytes. Liquid-liquid purification using n-hexane in combination with PSA efficiently removed the interferences during porcine and milk sample extraction. The developed method is sensitive and reliable for detection of the three target drugs in a single chromatographic run.

26786170,"Simple high-throughput procedures were developed for the direct analysis of glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine] and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in human and bovine milk and human urine matrices. Samples were extracted with an acidified aqueous solution on a high-speed shaker. Stable isotope labeled internal standards were added with the extraction solvent to ensure accurate tracking and quantitation. An additional cleanup procedure using partitioning with methylene chloride was required for milk matrices to minimize the presence of matrix components that can impact the longevity of the analytical column. Both analytes were analyzed directly, without derivatization, by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using two separate precursor-to-product transitions that ensure and confirm the accuracy of the measured results. Method performance was evaluated during validation through a series of assessments that included linearity, accuracy, precision, selectivity, ionization effects and carryover. Limits of quantitation (LOQ) were determined to be 0.1 and 10 µg/L (ppb) for urine and milk, respectively, for both glyphosate and AMPA. Mean recoveries for all matrices were within 89-107% at three separate fortification levels including the LOQ. Precision for replicates was ≤ 7.4% relative standard deviation (RSD) for milk and ≤ 11.4% RSD for urine across all fortification levels. All human and bovine milk samples used for selectivity and ionization effects assessments were free of any detectable levels of glyphosate and AMPA. Some of the human urine samples contained trace levels of glyphosate and AMPA, which were background subtracted for accuracy assessments. Ionization effects testing showed no significant biases from the matrix. A successful independent external validation was conducted using the more complicated milk matrices to demonstrate method transferability.","Journal of environmental science and health. Part.

26758942,"A novel label-free fluorescence 'turn-on' nanosensor has been developed for highly selective and sensitive detection of phosphorylated species (Ps) in biological samples and living cells. The design strategy relies on the use of Ti(4+)-immobilized polydopamine (PDA) coated reduced graphene oxide (rGO@PDA-Ti(4+)) that serves as an attractive platform to bind riboflavin 5'-monophosphate molecules (FMNs) through ion-pair interactions between phosphate groups and Ti(4+). The as-prepared rGO@PDA-Ti(4+)-FMNs (nanosensor), fluoresce only weakly due to the ineffective Förster resonance energy transfer between the FMNs and rGO@PDA-Ti(4+). The experimental findings revealed that the microwave-assisted interaction of the nanosensor with α-, β-casein, ovalbumin, human serum, non-fat milk, egg white, and living cells (all containing Ps) releases FMNs (due to the high formation constant between phosphate groups and Ti(4+)), leading to an excellent fluorescence 'turn-on' response. The fluorescence spectroscopy, confocal microscopy, and MALDI-TOF MS spectrometry were used to detect Ps both qualitatively and quantitatively. Under the optimized conditions, the nanosensor showed a detection limit of ca. 118.5, 28.9, and 54.8 nM for the tryptic digests of α-, β-casein and ovalbumin, respectively. Furthermore, the standard addition method was used as a bench-mark proof for phosphopeptide quantification in egg white samples.

Analyses of AFB1 and AFM1 in food samples were conducted by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Biomarkers in serum and urine were determined by tandem mass spectrometry. AFB1 and AFM1 were detected in 38 samples of cereals (28%, N=136) and 31 milk products (36%, N=86), respectively.

26708628,"The determination of both the water-soluble and lipid-soluble vitamin D compounds in human biological fluids is necessary to illuminate potentially significant biochemical mechanisms. The lack of analytical methods to quantify the water-soluble forms precludes studies on their role and biological functions; currently available liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods are able to determine only a single sulfated form of Vitamin D. We describe here a highly sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of four sulfated forms of vitamin D: vitamins D2- and D3-sulfate (D2-S and D3-S) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D2- and D3-sulfate (25(OH)D2-S and 25(OH)D3-S). A comparative evaluation showed that the ionization efficiencies of underivatized forms in negative ion mode electrospray ionisation (ESI) are superior to those of the derivatized (using 4-phenyl-l,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione (PTAD)) forms in positive ion mode ESI. Separation was optimised to minimise co-elution with endogenous matrix compounds, thereby reducing ion suppression/enhancement effects. Isotopically labelled analogues of each compound were used as internal standards to correct for ion suppression/enhancement effects. The method was validated and then applied for the analysis of breastmilk and human serum. The detection limits, repeatability standard deviations, and recoveries ranged from 0.20 to 0.28fmol, 2.8 to 10.2%, and 81.1 to 102%, respectively. ","Journal of chromatography.

Tryptic digest products from several standard proteins and two real samples (non-fat milk and serum) were enriched using Ti-CTS to demonstrate the efficiency of this method. The results showed that this composite enables high sensitive and selective phosphopeptide enrichment from casein variants, non-fat milk and human serum. Furthermore, multi-phosphorylated peptides with three serine phospholated sites (S*S*S*) demonstrated high affinity to Ti-CTS.

26663084,"The type I fatty acid synthase (FASN) is responsible for the de novo synthesis of palmitate. Chain length selection and release is performed by the C-terminal thioesterase domain (TE1). FASN expression is up-regulated in cancer, and its activity levels are controlled by gene dosage and transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. In addition, the chain length of fatty acids produced by FASN is controlled by a type II thioesterase called TE2 (E.C. 3.1.2.14). TE2 has been implicated in breast cancer and generates a broad lipid distribution within milk. The molecular basis for the ability of the TE2 to compete with TE1 for the acyl chain attached to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain of FASN is unknown. Herein, we show that human TE1 efficiently hydrolyzes acyl-CoA substrate mimetics. In contrast, TE2 prefers an engineered human acyl-ACP substrate and readily releases short chain fatty acids from full-length FASN during turnover. The 2.8 Å crystal structure of TE2 reveals a novel capping domain insert within the α/β hydrolase core. This domain is reminiscent of capping domains of type II thioesterases involved in polyketide synthesis. The structure also reveals that the capping domain had collapsed onto the active site containing the Ser-101-His-237-Asp-212 catalytic triad. This observation suggests that the capping domain opens to enable the ACP domain to dock and to place the acyl chain and 4'-phosphopantetheinyl-linker arm correctly for catalysis. Thus, the ability of TE2 to prematurely release fatty acids from FASN parallels the role of editing thioesterases involved in polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide synthase synthases.

Presently, clinically relevant protocols for storing and handling human milk that minimize error and variability in oxylipin and endocannabinoid concentrations are lacking. In this study, we compared the individual and combined effects of the following storage conditions on the stability of these fatty acid metabolites in human milk: state (fresh or frozen), storage temperature (4 °C, -20 °C or -80 °C), and duration (1 day, 1 week or 3 months). Thirteen endocannabinoids and related compounds, as well as 37 oxylipins were analyzed simultaneously by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Twelve endocannabinoids and related compounds (2-111 nM) and 31 oxylipins (1.2 pM-1242 nM) were detected, with highest levels being found for 2-arachidonoylglycerol and 17(R)hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid, respectively. The concentrations of most endocannabinoid-related compounds and oxylipins were dependent on storage condition, and especially storage at 4 °C introduced significant variability. Our findings suggest that human milk samples should be analyzed immediately after, or within one day of collection (if stored at 4 °C). Storage at -80 °C is required for long-term preservation, and storage at -20 °C is acceptable for no more than one week.

The occurrence of DDTs in island populations may be elevated if the island is adjacent to major DDT consumption estuaries, such as the Yangtze River Delta. In this study, colostrum samples were collected from maternal-neonate pairs (n = 106) from the Shengsi Island, located directly downstream from the Yangtze River outlet. DDT isomers and enantiomer compositions were analyzed by gas chromatography equipped with mass spectrometer (GC/MS) and GC/MS-MS. The average levels of p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDT and total DDTs were 1.32, 0.03, 0.09, 0.08, 0.48, and 1.93 μg g(-1) lipid weight, respectively. Maternal age and pregnancy body mass index (BMI) were positively associated with levels of DDTs (p < 0.05). High (DDE+DDD)/DDT and p,p'-DDE/p,p'-DDT ratios suggested that current DDT residues originated primarily from historical use of DDT products, but new sources may also contribute partially to some high o,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDT ratios. Enantiomeric enrichment was found for the (-)-enantiomer of o,p'-DDD and the (+)-enantiomer of o,p'-DDT, suggesting stereoselective attenuation. Based on breast milk consumption, the average daily intake of DDTs by neonates was 8.33 ± 7.34 μg kg(-1)bw per day, which exceeded the WHO's tolerable daily intake guideline of 0.01 mg kg(-1) bw per day by 25%, implying some neonates in the Yangtze River region are potentially at high risk from exposure to DDTs.","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)","['D000328', 'D002681', 'D003126', 'D003634', 'D004781', 'D004784', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D007223', 'D007231', 'D008297', 'D008895', 'D011247', 'D045483', 'D014874', 'D055815']","['Adult', 'China', 'Colostrum', 'DDT', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Milk, Human', 'Pregnancy', 'Rivers', 'Water Pollutants, Chemical', 'Young Adult']",Levels and patterns of DDTs in maternal colostrum from an island population and exposure of neonates.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26650085,2016,0
26643725,"Recently, there has been an increasing trend towards multi-targeted analysis and non-target screening methods as a means to increase the number of monitored analytes. Previous studies have developed biomonitoring methods which specifically focus on only a small number of analytes with similar physico-chemical properties. In this paper, we present a simple and rapid multi-residue method for simultaneous extraction of polar and non-polar organic chemicals from biological matrices, containing up to 5% lipid content. Our method combines targeted multi-residue analysis using gas chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-QqQ-MS/MS) and a multi-targeted analysis complemented with non-target screening using liquid chromatography coupled to a quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS/MS). The optimization of the chemical extraction procedure and the effectiveness of different clean-up methods were evaluated for two biological matrices: fish muscle (lipid content ∼2%) and breast milk (∼4%). To extract a wide range of chemicals, the partition/extraction procedure used for the QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) approach was tested as the initial step for the extraction of 77 target compounds covering a broad compound domain. All the target analytes have different physico-chemical properties (log Kow ranges from -0.3 to 10) and cover a broad activity spectrum; from polar pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PPCPs) to highly lipophilic chemicals such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organochloride pesticides (OCPs). A number of options were explored for the clean-up of lipids, proteins and other impurities present in the matrix. Zirconium dioxide-based sorbents as dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) and protein-lipid removal filter cartridges (Captiva ND Lipids) provided the best results for GC-MS and LC-MS analysis respectively. The method was fully validated for samples of fish muscle and breast milk through the evaluation of recoveries, matrix effects, limit of quantification, linearity and precision (inter-day and intra-day). Mean recoveries (n=5) were between 70 and 120% with relative standard deviations (RSD) less than 20% in most of the cases. GC-MS/MS LOQs ranged from 0.08 to 3μg/kg and LC-QTOF-MS/MS LOQs ranged from 0.2 to 9μg/kg. The developed strategy was successfully applied for analysis of real samples; 22 target analytes were found in the breast milk samples and 10 in the fish samples.

The method is based on the simultaneous protein precipitation and AFM1 extraction, by salt-induced liquid-liquid extraction (SI-LLE), followed by an online solid-phase extraction (online SPE) coupled to ultra-high-pressure-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis to the automatic pre-concentration, clean up and sensitive and selective determination of AFM1. The main parameters affecting the extraction efficiency and accuracy of the analytical method were studied in detail. In the optimal conditions, acetonitrile and NaCl were used as extraction/denaturant solvent and salting-out agent in SI-LLE, respectively. After centrifugation, the organic phase (acetonitrile) was diluted with water (1:9 v/v) and purified (1mL) by online C18 cartridge coupled with an UHPLC column. Finally, selected reaction monitoring (SRM) acquisition mode was applied to the detection of AFM1. Validation studies were carried out on different dairy products (whole and skimmed cow milk, yogurt, goat milk, and powder infant formula), providing method quantification limits about 25 times lower than AFM1 maximum levels permitted by EU regulation 1881/2006 in milk and dairy products for direct human consumption. Recoveries (86-102%) and repeatability (RSD<3, n=6) meet the performance criteria required by EU regulation N. 401/2006 for the determination of the levels of mycotoxins in foodstuffs. Moreover, no matrix effects were observed in the different milk and dairy products studied. The proposed method improves the performance of AFM1 analysis in milk samples as AFM1 determination is performed with a degree of accuracy higher than the conventional methods.

Pathway assessments predict subtle effects due to WP in moderating xenobiotic metabolism, promoting proliferation and various other cellular functions in differentiating enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells.

Human milk is recommended as the optimal source of nutrients for infants and young children, and it has been associated to several short- and long-term benefits. For this reason, its composition is used as a reference for designing infant formulas. However, the available information on the hormonal levels of these dairy products is scarce, and it is usually limited to estradiol and estrone. In the present study, six natural sex hormones (pregnenolone, progesterone, estrone, dehydroepiandrosterone, testosterone and androstenedione) have been extracted from sixteen milk-based infant formulas and analyzed with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The purpose of this research was to quantify natural steroid hormones in various infant formulas, to provide food and nutrition practitioners with information to estimate intakes in children. In addition, data found in the literature was used for comparison. The findings suggest that there are certain similarities between bovine milk and dairy products for infants. Furthermore, the detected levels were in general lower than those observed in human milk and/or colostrum.

A comprehensive survey on triacylglycerol (TAG) molecular species in milk that contain at least one type of n-3 LC-PUFA, namely eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and docosapentaenoic acid, was conducted in this work using HPLC-linear trap quadrupole-Orbitrap and HPLC-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry techniques. A total of 51 TAG species that contain n-3 LC-PUFA have been identified in bovine milk and their structures assigned. The TAG species containing docosahexaenoic acid were found in much smaller number and at much lower abundance compared with the other 2 types of TAG. An HPLC-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry-based method was developed, which provides relative quantification of all these TAG species in a run of 36 min. Application of this method to the quantification of n-3 LC-PUFA-incorporated TAG in 32 individual animal milk samples allowed us to determine variation between animals, identify strong metabolic relationships between TAG species, and reveal negative effect of a grape marc supplement on the accumulation of eicosapentaenoic acid in milk.

It has been found that the addition of anionic surfactant causes the accumulation of the cationic analytes at the SLM/solution interface resulting in an easier transfer of the analytes into the organic phase. The method was accomplished with 1-octanol as the acceptor phase and supported liquid membrane (SLM) by means of an 80 V pulsed electrical driving force and the extraction time of 20 min. The model analytes were extracted from 3.0 mL sample solution (pH 4.0) containing 0.02% w/v surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate). The duty cycle of 92% and frequency of 0.357 Hz gave the best performance. Extraction recoveries in the range of 70.5-95.2% and satisfactory repeatability (7.6<RSD<13.7) were obtained.

It is observed that total zinc content in human milk decreases continuously during the first month of lactation, both for preterm and full term gestations.

Dehydro PAs enter the food and feed chain by co-harvesting of crops intended for human and animal consumption as well as by carry-over into animal-based products such as milk, eggs and honey. Recently the occurrence of dehydro PAs in teas and herbal teas has gained increasing attention from the EU, due to the high levels of dehydro PAs found in commercially available teas and herbal teas in Germany and Switzerland. Furthermore, several tropane alkaloids (TAs, e.g. scopolamine and hyoscyamine) intoxications due to the consumption of contaminated herbal teas were reported in the literature. The aim of the present study was to determine the dehydro PAs and TAs levels in 70 pre-packed teabags of herbal and non-herbal tea types sold in supermarkets in Israel. Chamomile, peppermint and rooibos teas contained high dehydro PAs levels in almost all samples analysed. Lower amounts were detected in black and green teas, while no dehydro PAs were found in fennel and melissa herbal teas. Total dehydro PAs concentrations in chamomile, peppermint and rooibos teas ranged from 20 to 1729 μg/kg. Except for black tea containing only mono-ester retrorsine-type dehydro PAs, all other teas and herbal teas showed mixed patterns of dehydro PA ester types, indicating a contamination by various weed species during harvesting and/or production. The TA levels per teabag were below the recommended acute reference dose; however, the positive findings of TAs in all peppermint tea samples warrant a more extensive survey. The partially high levels of dehydro PAs found in teas and herbal teas present an urgent warning letter to the regulatory authorities to perform routine quality control analysis and implement maximum residual levels for dehydro PAs.","Food additives & contaminants.

The thermosensitive plasmid pGh9:ISS1 was employed to generate osmotic stress resistant (osmr) mutants of S. macedonicus. Three osmr mutants showing integration of the vector in unique chromosomal sites were identified and the disrupted loci were characterized. Interestingly, the mutants were able to grow and to produce macedocin at considerably higher concentrations of NaCl compared to the wild-type (up to 4.0%w/v). The production of macedocin under hyperosmotic conditions solely by the osmr mutants was validated by the well diffusion assay and by mass spectrometry analysis. RT-PCR experiments demonstrated that the macedocin biosynthetic regulon was transcribed at high salt concentrations only in the mutants. Mutant osmr3, the most robust mutant, was converted in its markerless derivative (osmr3f). Co-culture of S. macedonicus with spores of Clostridium tyrobutyricum in milk demonstrated that only the osmr3f mutant and not the wild-type inhibited the growth of the spores under hyperosmotic conditions (i.e., 2.5%w/v NaCl) due to the production of macedocin.

26268368,"For breastfed infants, human milk is more than a source of nutrients; it furnishes a wide array of proteins, peptides, antibodies, and other components promoting neonatal growth and protecting infants from viral and bacterial infection. It has been proposed that most biological processes are performed by protein complexes. Therefore, identification and characterization of human milk components including protein complexes is important for understanding the function of milk. Using gel filtration, we have purified a stable high molecular mass (~1000 kDa) multiprotein complex (SPC) from 15 preparations of human milk. Light scattering and gel filtration showed that the SPC was stable in the presence of high concentrations of NaCl and MgCl2 but dissociated efficiently under the conditions that destroy immunocomplexes (2 M MgCl2 , 0.5 M NaCl, and 10 mM DTT). Such a stable complex is unlikely to be a casual associate of different proteins. The relative content of the individual SPCs varied from 6% to 25% of the total milk protein. According to electrophoretic and mass spectrometry analysis, all 15 SPCs contained lactoferrin (LF) and α-lactalbumin as major proteins, whereas human milk albumin and β-casein were present in moderate or minor amounts; a different content of IgGs and sIgAs was observed. All SPCs efficiently hydrolyzed Plasmid supercoiled DNA and maltoheptaose. Some freshly prepared SPC preparations contained not only intact LF but also small amounts of its fragments, which appeared in all SPCs during their prolonged storage; the fragments, similar to intact LF, possessed DNase and amylase activities. LF is found in human epithelial secretions, barrier body fluids, and in the secondary granules of leukocytes. LF is a protein of the acute phase response and nonspecific defense against different types of microbial and viral infections. Therefore, LF complexes with other proteins may be important for its functions not only in human milk.",Journal of molecular recognition : JMR,"['D000681', 'D002850', 'D003851', 'D004591', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D008895', 'D008970', 'D046912', 'D055550', 'D019032']","['Amylases', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Milk, Human', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Protein Stability', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",Very stable high molecular mass multiprotein complex with DNase and amylase activities in human milk.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None]","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26268368,2016,0

Western diet provides low ALA and DHA, which is reflected in low DHA in maternal milk. Chia oil extracted from chia (Salvia hispanica L.), a plant native to some Latin American countries, is high in ALA (up to 60%) and thereby is an alternative to provide ALA with the aim to reduce DHA deficits. We evaluated the modification of the fatty acid profile of milk obtained from Chilean mothers who received chia oil during gestation and nursing. Forty healthy pregnant women (22-35 years old) tabulated for food consumption, were randomly separated into two groups: a control group with normal feeding (n = 21) and a chia group (n = 19), which received 16 mL chia oil daily from the third trimester of pregnancy until the first six months of nursing. The fatty acid profile of erythrocyte phospholipids, measured at six months of pregnancy, at time of delivery and at six months of nursing, and the fatty acid profile of the milk collected during the first six months of nursing were assessed by gas-chromatography. The chia group, compared to the control group, showed (i) a significant increase in ALA ingestion and a significant reduction of linoleic acid (LA) ingestion, no showing modification of arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and DHA; (ii) a significant increase of erythrocyte ALA and EPA and a reduction of LA. AA and DHA were not modified; (iii) a increased milk content of ALA during the six months of nursing, whereas LA showed a decrease. AA and EPA were not modified, however DHA increased only during the first three months of nursing. Consumption of chia oil during the last trimester of pregnancy and the first three months of nursing transiently increases the milk content of DHA.

The optimal immobilization conditions were investigated, including time course, initial protein concentration and solution pH. The sn-1,3 specificity of lipases under different immobilization conditions was evaluated and identified as positively associated with the lipase activity, and the pH of the immobilization solution influenced the regiospecificity and synthetic activity of these lipases. Immobilized AOL D3520, as the biocatalyst, was used for the enzymatic synthesis of the structured lipid OPO through the acidolysis between palm stearin and OA.

In this study, carboxyl cotton chelator-titanium(IV) (CCC-Ti4+) fibers, a novel CCC-based fibrous sorbent with excellent biocompatibility, were successfully synthesized on the basis of the coordination effect between double carboxyl groups on CCC and Ti4+. The synthesis of CCC-Ti4+ fibers was easy, and the incorporated titanium content was high. On the basis of immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC), CCC-Ti4+ fibers were used for specific capture of phosphopeptides using a lab-in-syringe solid-phase extraction (SPE) from multiple biological samples, including standard protein digests, nonfat milk digests, human serum, and animal tissue. The proposed sorbent exhibited high selectivity (β-casein/BSA=1:1000) and good sensitivity (10 fmol) in phosphopeptides analysis. Meanwhile, the lab-in-syringe SPE greatly simplified the entire process of enrichment. Thanks to the good biocompatibility of CCC-based material, CCC-Ti4+ fibers showed excellent performance in phosphopeptide enrichment from protein-rich human serum. Finally, CCC-Ti4+ fibers were applied for selective capture of phosphopeptides from tryptic digests of rat brain lysate followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. Using the proposed method, we identified 3950 unique phosphosites from 1 mg of rat brain in a single experiment, which is much better than previously reported IMAC-based strategies.

The aim of our work was to include chlordecone in a multi organochlorine residue method preventing any degradation during the analytical process and thus allowing quantification at ppt (ngkg(-1) or ngL(-1)) levels for a wide range of OCPs in breast milk, human serum and adipose tissue. After GC-HRMS vs. MS/MS and EI vs. APCI comparisons, the major improvement in terms of sensitivity was found in decreasing the length and film thickness of the gas chromatography column. Thanks to a linear correlation between relative response and quantity of chlordecone injected, LC-(ESI-)-MS/MS was finally preferred. An acetonitrile based gradient optimized on a C30 coreshell HPLC column has led to reaching limits of quantification as low as 8ngL(-1), 25pgmL(-1) and 0.2ngg(-1) fat for breast milk, serum and adipose tissue, respectively, allowing multiresidue OCP quantification at concentration levels compatible with biomonitoring purposes and pre-requisites.

Their massive and illegal use in animal therapy and prophylaxis inevitably causes the presence of traces in foods of animal origin (milk and meat), which creates several problems for human health. With the aim to prevent the negative impact of β-lactam and, in particular, PenG residues present in the milk on customer health, many countries have established maximum residue limits (MRLs). To cope with this problem here, we propose an effective alternative, compared to the analytical methods actually employed, to quantify the presence of penicillin G using the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) method. In particular, the PenG molecule was conjugated to a protein carrier to immunize a rabbit and produce polyclonal antibodies (anti-PenG). The produced antibodies were used as molecular recognition elements for the design of a competitive immune-assay for the detection of PenG by SPR experiments. The detection limit of the developed assay was found to be 8.0 pM, a value much lower than the MRL of the EU regulation limit that is fixed at 12 nM.

The thick layer renders the nanoparticles with perfect hydrophilic character, super large surface area, large immobilization of the Fe(3+) ions and the special porous structure. Specifically, the as-synthesized MOF-decorated magnetic nanoparticles own an ultra large surface area which is up to 168.66 m(2) g(-1) as well as two appropriate pore sizes of 1.93 and 3.91 nm with a narrow grain-size distribution and rapid separation under the magnetic circumstance. The unique features vested the synthesized nanoparticles an excellent ability for phosphopeptides enrichment with high selectivity for β-casein (molar ratio of β-casein/BSA, 1:500), large enrichment capacity (60 mg g(-1)), low detection limit (0.5 fmol), excellent phosphopeptides recovery (above 84.47%), fine size-exclusion of high molecular weight proteins, good reusability, and desirable batch-to-batch repeatability. Furthermore, encouraged by the experimental results, we successfully performed the as-prepared porous IMAC nanoparticle in the specific capture of phosphopeptides from the human serum (both the healthy and unhealthy) and nonfat milk, which proves itself to be a good candidate for the enrichment and detection of the low-abundant phosphopeptides from complicated biological samples.

However, research in this area has been undeveloped largely because the kinases that phosphorylate secreted proteins have escaped identification. Fam20C is a kinase that phosphorylates S-x-E/pS motifs on proteins in milk and in the extracellular matrix of bones and teeth. Here, we show that Fam20C generates the majority of the extracellular phosphoproteome. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, mass spectrometry, and biochemistry, we identify more than 100 secreted phosphoproteins as genuine Fam20C substrates. Further, we show that Fam20C exhibits broader substrate specificity than previously appreciated. Functional annotations of Fam20C substrates suggest roles for the kinase beyond biomineralization, including lipid homeostasis, wound healing, and cell migration and adhesion.

The aim of the present study was to characterize the bacterial antibiotic-resistant high-risk lineages colonizing preterm infants during their NICU stay and their persistence in faeces after 2 years. A total of 26 preterm neonates were recruited between October 2009 and June 2010 and provided 144 faecal samples. Milk samples (86 mother's milk, 35 human donor milk and 15 formula milk) were collected at the same time as faecal samples. An additional faecal sample was recovered in 16 infants at the age of 2 years. Samples were plated onto different selective media, and one colony per morphology was selected. Isolates were identified by 16S rDNA nucleotide sequence and MALDI-TOF. Antibiotic susceptibility (agar dilution), genetic diversity (RAPD, PFGE and MLST) and virulence factors (only in enterococcal and staphylococcal isolates) were determined by PCR. A high proportion of antibiotic-resistant high-risk clones was detected in both faecal and milk samples during the NICU admittance. Almost all infants were colonized by Enterococcus faecalis ST64 and Enterococcus faecium ST18 clones, while a wider genetic diversity was observed for the Gram-negative isolates. Multidrug-resistant high-risk clones were not recovered from the faecal samples of the 2-year-olds.

One hundred twelve individual milk and blood serum samples were collected from 16 lactating donkeys (Martina-Franca-derived population; 6 to 12 yr old; 3 to 7 parities; average live weight 205.4kg; 32 to 58 d after foaling at the beginning of the trial) during a 3-mo-long experiment. The samples were analyzed for the aforementioned elements by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Feedstuff and drinking water were also analyzed for the investigated elements. Data were processed by ANOVA for repeated measures. Average milk concentrations (±SD) of Ti, Rb, Sr, Mo, Cs, and Pb were 77.3 (±7.7), 339.1 (±82.1), 881.7 (±270.4), 4.5 (±1.6), 0.49 (±0.09), and 3.2 (±2.7) μg/L, respectively. More than 80% of samples were below the limit of detection for V, As, and Cd in milk and for Cd, and Pb in blood serum. The lower bound calculated for milk V, As, and Cd was 0.03μg/L for the 3 elements, the upper bound was calculated at 0.23, 0.10, and 0.31μg/L and the maximum value was observed at 0.54, 0.15, and 0.51μg/L, respectively. The average milk concentrations of Ti, Rb, Sr, Mo, and Cs were 600, 458, 346, 16, and 294%, respectively, than those of blood serum.

Moderate to strong positive and significant correlation coefficients were observed between milk and blood serum concentrations for Ti, Rb, Sr, and Cs. The effect of the stage of lactation was significant for all the investigated elements in milk and blood serum, but most of the elements showed only small changes or inconsistent trends, and only the concentrations of Rb and Sr showed decreasing trends both in milk and blood serum. The relationship between milk and blood serum element concentrations indicates that the mammary gland plays a role in determining the milk concentrations of Mo, Ti, Rb, Sr, Mo, and Cs.

Using electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometry with Zeeman correction, we have optimized this method with two chemical modifiers and without digestion for analytical procedure. Detection limits and quantification limits for Cu in human milk were found to be 0.077 and 0.26 μmol/L, respectively. Within-run (n = 30) and between-run (n = 15) variations in a pool of human milk samples were 1.50 and 3.62%, respectively. Average recoveries ranged from 98.67 to 100.61%. The reliability of this method was also confirmed by analysing certified reference material (10%). In breast milk samples collected from 100 lactating mothers, Cu mean (±1 SD) was 7.09 ± 1.60 μmol/L. In conclusion, with minimal preparation and quick determination, the method proposed is suitable for measurement of Cu in human breast milk.",Biological trace element research,"['D002623', 'D003300', 'D006801', 'D008895', 'D013054']","['Chemistry Techniques, Analytical', 'Copper', 'Humans', 'Milk, Human', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic']",Optimisation of Direct Copper Determination in Human Breast Milk Without Digestion by Zeeman Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry with Two Chemical Modifiers.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None]","[None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25876083,2016,0
25859614,"Metal oxides show high selectivity and sensitivity toward mass spectrometry based enrichment strategies. Phosphopeptides/phosphoproteins enrichment from biological samples is cumbersome because of their low abundance. Phosphopeptides are of interest in enzymes and phosphorylation pathways which lead to the clinical links of a disease. Magnetic core-shell lanthanide oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4@SiO2-La2O3 and Fe3O4@SiO2-Sm2O3) are fabricated, characterized by SEM, FTIR, and EDX and employed in the enrichment of phosphopeptides. The nanoparticles enrich phosphopeptides from casein variants, nonfat milk, egg yolk, human serum and HeLa cell extract. The materials and enrichment protocols are designed in a way that there are almost no nonspecific bindings. The selectivity is achieved up to 1:8500 using β-casein/BSA mixture and sensitivity down to 1 atto-mole. Batch-to-batch reproducibility is high with the reuse of core-shell nanoparticles up to four cycles. The enrichment followed by MALDI-MS analyses is carried out for the identification of phosphopeptides from serum digest and HeLa cell extract. Characteristic phosphopeptides of phosphoproteins are identified from human serum after the enrichment, which have the diagnostic potential toward prostate cancer. Thus, the lanthanide based magnetic core-shell materials offer a highly selective and sensitive workflow in phosphoproteomics.

Daily BM analysis for TFO increases neonatal intensive care unit work load by 10-15 min/patient/day and may not be feasible in all nurseries. The variation of macronutrient intake when BM analysis is done for various schedules was studied. In an observational study, we analyzed 21 subsequent samples of native 24-h BM batches, which had been prepared for 10 healthy infants (gestational age 26.1 ± 1.3 weeks, birth weight: 890 ± 210 g). Levels of protein and fat (validated near-infrared milk analyzer), as well as lactose (UPLC-MS/MS) generated the database for modelling TFO to meet recommendations of European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition. Intake of macronutrients and energy were calculated for different schedules of BM measurements for TFO (n = 1/week; n = 2/week; n = 3/week; n = 5/week; n = 7/week) and compared to native and fixed dose fortified BM. Day-to-day variation of macronutrients (protein 20%, carbohydrate 13%, fat 17%, energy 10%) decreased as the frequency of milk analysis increased and was almost zero for protein and carbohydrate with daily measurements. Measurements two/week led to mean macronutrient intake within a range of ± 5% of targeted levels. A reduced schedule for macronutrient measurement may increase the practical use of TFO.

25830907,"3-Monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) is a heat-induced food contaminant that has been widely investigated for decades. This paper presents an overview of current knowledge about 3-MCPD, including its formation routes, occurrence in various foodstuffs, analytical approach, toxicological aspects, and future research perspectives. So far, 3-MCPD was determined in its free and bound form in thermally treated foods, edible oils and fats, and infant foods including human breast milk. Contaminants in infant foods and human breast milk were highlighted in this paper as a serious problem as they can pose a potential hazard for infants. The analytical approach of 3-MCPD determination has been modified for over a decade. Nowadays, the method based on determining the derivative of this compound by using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry is widely used. However, there is still a big need for developing new methods that would produce repeatable results. Some of the toxicologic aspects associated with 3-MCPD still remain unknown. A number of studies on the carcinogenicity and genotoxicity of 3-MCPD were carried out on rodents; however, no clinical studies on humans have been reported so far. Moreover, both detrimental effect on kidneys and antifertility activity have been widely reported. The knowledge of 3-MCPD absorption into body fluids and tissues and its metabolic pathways is based on sometimes conflicting data derived from different studies. In conclusion, although a lot of research has been carried out on 3-MCPD, there is still a need for further research in this area.

The NSAIDs considered are carprofen, diclofenac, flufenamic acid, flunixin (5-hydroxyflunixin as marker metabolite in milk), ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, meloxicam, 4-methylaminoantipyrine (marker metabolite of metamizole in meat and milk), naproxen, niflumic acid, phenylbutazone (and metabolite oxyphenbutazone), ramifenazone, salicylic acid, and tolfenamic acid. These compounds were chosen as representatives of different chemical subclasses of NSAIDs. Flunixin-d3, diclofenac-d4, 4-aminoantipyrine-d3, and phenylbutazone-d10 were used as internal standards. Performance characteristics were validated according to the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC (Off J Eur Communities, L221: 8-36). Recovery percentages varied between 81 and 114% for bovine meat and between 79 and 118% for milk. Repeatability percentages were within the range of 1-12% for meat and between 1 and 17% for milk, whereas the intralaboratory reproducibility varied between 3 and 19% for meat and between 3 and 23% for milk. The decision limit and the detection capability for bovine meat were within the range of 0.5-579 μg kg(-1)and 0.6-642 μg kg(-1), respectively.

Such a wafer is used as a novel sample support to allow fast selective enrichment, wash-free self-desalting and mass spectroscopy (MS) analysis of phosphopeptides, thanks to the high Ti(4+) loading amount, pure phosphate polymer-Ti(4+) interface, and strong hydrophobic-hydrophilic attraction pattern. The detection sensitivity was enhanced 300 folds compared with what was obtained using the common MALDI plate. Remarkable selectivity for phosphopeptides can be achieved at a molar ratio as low as 1 : 500 of phosphopeptides (casein digest)/nonphosphopeptides (BSA). High-quality mass spectra can be obtained even in the presence of NaCl (1 M), NH4HCO3 (100 mM), or urea (1 M). These microspots were also used to selectively capture phosphopeptides from milk and human serum, which further demonstrated that they were capable of identifying low-abundance phosphopeptides from real complex samples. They provide a low detection limit (3 fmol μL(-1)), small sample size, and excellent enrichment and desalting efficiency. Such a method significantly simplifies the analytical procedures, reduces possible sample loss, and is relatively low cost.

A high-titer rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb-DMP) targeting DMP was obtained, and the procedures of BA-ELISA were optimized for the determination of DMP in milk and milk products. Under optimal conditions, good linearity was achieved within a range of 0.024 to 6.027 μg L(-1), with low cross-reactivity values for DMP structural analogues (lower than 10%). The median inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 0.356 μg L(-1) and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.0082 μg L(-1).

The suppleness of the dermis is affected by the formation of bridges between proteins and sugars (Maillard's reaction). The accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in skin plays a very important role in skin ageing. Therefore, natural compounds or extracts that possess antiglycation activities may have great anti-ageing potential. In the present study, Silybum marianum flower extract (SMFE) was demonstrated to possess antiglycation activity. We found that SMFE inhibits glycation reaction between BSA and glucose. In addition, antiglycation activity of SMFE was confirmed in a human skin explants model. SMFE reduced Nε-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) expression, whereas SMFE stimulated fibrillin-1 expression compared to treatment with methyglyoxal. An active ingredient contributing to the observed activities was identified as silibinin. The antiglycation activity of silibinin was dose-dependent.

25701473,"The human body is not a chemically uncontaminated system. Every simple action that humans undertake, such as drinking water, eating, nursing, and even breathing air, puts the system under environmental xenobiotic exposure stress. Environmental chemicals have been shown to produce unwanted effects on health and remove the right to healthy living, starting from the first encounter in utero to geriatrics, throughout the lifespan. Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels, important members of the persistent organic pollutants (POPs), have been detected before in human breast milk and also in the adipose tissue of women from different regions of Turkey; however, there was no information about the blood levels of these chemicals. This study generated the first information that evaluates OCP and PCB contamination levels in the blood of the women living in Turkey. The current study measured the blood concentrations of OCPs and PCBs in 58 healthy women (age 20-41 years; mean age 28 years) who were living in Istanbul, Turkey, in the years 2010-2012. Samples were analyzed for 29 OCPs and 18 PCB congeners using high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). PCB 153 was the predominant congener (643.2 pg/g lipid), followed by PCB 138 and PCB 180. 4,4'-DDE (24872.8 pg/g lipid) was the most common organochlorinated pesticide contaminant in studied blood samples. Results for analyzed chlorinated compounds were as follows: ∑PCB 2682 ± 3300 pg/g lipid; ∑DDT 25,938 ± 28,644 pg/g lipid; and ∑HCH 2930 ± 2222 pg/g lipid, respectively. The mean concentration of ∑WHOPCB-TEQ was 0.037 pg/g on a lipid basis.

The bioaccessibility of mycotoxins was determined by a dynamic simulated gastrointestinal digestion system, imitating the human digestive physiological conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Mycotoxins were determined in the simulated intestinal fluids by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). EN bioaccessibility ranged from 15.1 to 30.6%, whereas the values evidenced for BEA ranged from 12 to 19%. DON showed bioaccessibility data ranging from 0.8 to 5.6% whereas for ZEA the data evidenced ranged from 26 to 44%. The bioaccessibility reduction evidenced using probiotic microorganisms for the mycotoxins studied ranged from 21 to 27.1% for ENs, from 29 to 39.7% for DON, from 41 to 57% for ZEA and from 6.6 to 10.5% for BEA.

25645427,"In this study, a novel method for the highly selective enrichment of phosphopeptides using erbium phosphate doped poly(glycidyl methacrylate/ethylene dimethacrylate) spin columns is presented. Erbium phosphate was synthesized by precipitation from boiling phosphoric acid and incubated overnight in erbium chloride solutions. The resulting powder was embedded in a monolithic poly(glycidyl methacrylate/ethylene dimethacrylate) polymer. The monolith was synthesized in a spin column by radical polymerization. Erbium phosphate demonstrated a high affinity and selectivity for phosphopeptides due to the strong interaction of trivalent erbium ions with the phosphate groups of phosphopeptides. The high selectivity and performance of the designed spin columns were demonstrated by successfully enriching phosphopeptides from tryptically digested protein mixtures containing the model phosphoproteins α- and β-casein, bovine milk, and human saliva. By the implementation of several washing steps, unspecific components were removed and the enriched phosphopeptides were effectively eluted from the spin columns under alkaline conditions. The selective performance of the presented method was further demonstrated by the enrichment of two synthetic phosphopeptides, which were spiked in tryptically digested and dephosphorylated HeLa cell lysates at low ratios. Finally, the presented approach was compared to conventional phosphopeptide enrichment by titanium oxide and revealed higher recoveries for the erbium phosphate doped monoliths.

A group of 21 PFSAs was selected as target to evaluate the quantitative possibilities. Full scan MS acquisition data allows quantification at relevant low levels (0.1-50 ng L(-1) in water, 0.05-2 ng g(-1) in sediments, 0.01-5 ng g(-1) in fish and meat, and 0.005-2 ng g(-1) in human milk depending on the compound).

Although it is a highly glycosylated protein, its site-specific glycosylation and associated glycan micro-heterogeneity have still not been fully elucidated. In this study, the site-specific glycosylation of sIgA isolated from human colostrum (n = 3) was analyzed using a combination of LC-MS and LC-MS/MS and in-house software (Glycopeptide Finder). The majority of the glycans found are biantennary structures with one or more acidic Neu5Ac residues; however, a large fraction belonged to truncated complex structures with terminal GlcNAc. Multiple glycosites were identified with nearly 30 glycan compositions located at seven sites on the secretory component, six compositions at a single site on the J chain, and 16 compositions at five sites on the IgA heavy (H) chain. Site-specific heterogeneity and relative quantitation of each composition and the extent of occupation at each site were determined using nonspecific proteases. Additionally, 54 O-linked glycan compositions located at the IgA1 hinge region (HR) were identified by comparison against a theoretical O-glycopeptide library. This represents the most comprehensive report to date detailing the complexity of glycan micro-heterogeneity with relative quantitation of glycoforms for each glycosylation site on milk sIgA.

To investigate the potential contribution of bioactive peptides to the physiological effects of kefir, comprehensive analysis of the peptide profile was performed by nano-ESI-LTQ-Orbitrap MS coupled to nano-ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography. Thus, 257 peptides were identified, mainly released from β-casein, followed by αS1-, κ-, and αS2-casein. Most (236) peptides were uniquely detected in kefir, but not in raw milk indicating that the fermentation step does not only increase the proteolytic activity 1.7- to 2.4-fold compared to unfermented milk, but also alters the composition of the peptide fraction. The influence of the microflora was determined by analyzing kefir produced from traditional kefir grains or commercial starter culture. Kefir from starter culture featured 230 peptide sequences and showed a significantly, 1.4-fold higher proteolytic activity than kefir from kefir grains with 127 peptides. A match of 97 peptides in both varieties indicates the presence of a typical kefir peptide profile that is not influenced by the individual composition of the microflora.

25592255,"A high molecular weight protein (HMWP) was isolated and purified from sow milk, and some of its biochemical characteristics and biological functions were identified. The origin of HMWP was also investigated. The molecular weight of HMWP was determined to be about 115 000 and 114 800 by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration, respectively. The sequence of 10 amino acids in N-terminal of HMWP was Ala-Leu-Val-Gln-Ser-Cys-Leu-Asn-Leu-Val. The sequence was blasted against GenBank. No protein showed significant similarity with this sequence suggesting the HMWP may be novel. The result of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) also proved HMWP could be a novel protein. By amino acid assay, HMWP was rich in glutamate (including glutamine), cysteine, glycine, aspartic acid (including asparagines) and proline. The content of hydrophobic amino acids (Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Met, Phe and Pro) was lower at 18.59% of the total amino acids suggesting HMWP has high solubility in water. Western blots of lectins were used to identify the kinds of carbohydrate residues attached to HMWP qualitatively. The result showed that HMWP was a kind of glycoprotein containing N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc), mannose (Man) and/or N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). By isoelectric focusing, HMWP pI was found to be 5.1. Compared with milk fat globule membrane protein (MFGMP) isolated from the sow milk in SDS-PAGE, MFGMP did not contain HMWP. HMWP was assumed to be a secretory milk protein. HMWP was not found in bovine, goat, rabbit or human milk in SDS-PAGE gel suggesting HMWP may be unique to sow milk. By Western blot, HMWP could be detected in sow milk, not in sow serum, which suggests it is synthesized and secreted by the mammary gland. HMWP concentrations in sows milk were the lowest in the first day of lactation, rose significantly during lactation 1 to 7 days. The HMWP content of sows milk remained relatively constant ((1.95±0.13) g/l) during lactation 7 to 20 days. HMWP significantly inhibited Escherichia coli in a dose related manner in vitro.

The effectiveness of functional barrier layers was investigated in coloured polystyrene (PS) bowls due to their intended condition of use with hot liquids such as soups or stew. Migration experiments were performed over a 10-day period using USFDA-recommended food simulants (10% ethanol, 50% ethanol, corn oil and Miglyol) along with several other food oils. At the end of the 10 days, solvent dyes had migrated from the PS bowls at 12, 1 and 31,000 ng cm(-)(2) into coconut oil, palm kernel oil and Miglyol respectively, and in coconut oil and Miglyol the colour change was visible to the human eye. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images revealed that the functional barrier was no longer intact for the bowls exposed to coconut oil, palm kernel oil, Miglyol, 10% ethanol, 50% ethanol and goat's milk. Additional tests showed that 1-dodecanol, a lauryl alcohol derived from palm kernel oil and coconut oil, was present in the PS bowls at an average concentration of 11 mg kg(-1). This compound is likely to have been used as a dispersing agent for the solvent dye and aided the migration of the solvent dye from the PS bowl into the food simulant. The solvent dye was not found in the 10% ethanol, 50% ethanol and goat's milk food simulants above their respective limits of detection, which is likely to be due to its insolubility in aqueous solutions. A disrupted barrier layer is of concern because if there are unregulated materials in the inner layers of the laminate, they may migrate to food, and therefore be considered unapproved food additives resulting in the food being deemed adulterated under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act.","Food additives & contaminants.

25452312,"Epithelial cells lining the urinary tract secrete urinary exosomes (40-100 nm) that can be targeted to specific cells modulating their functionality. One potential targeting mechanism is adhesion between vesicle surface glycoproteins and target cells. This makes the glycopeptide analysis of exosomes important. Exosomes reflect the physiological state of the parent cells; therefore, they are a good source of biomarkers for urological and other diseases. Moreover, the urine collection is easy and noninvasive and urinary exosomes give information about renal and systemic organ systems. Accordingly, multiple studies on proteomic characterization of urinary exosomes in health and disease have been published. However, no systematic analysis of their glycoproteomic profile has been carried out to date, whereas a conserved glycan signature has been found for exosomes from urine and other sources including T cell lines and human milk. Here, we have enriched and identified the N-glycopeptides from these vesicles. These enriched N-glycopeptides were solved for their peptide sequence, glycan composition, structure, and glycosylation site using collision-induced dissociation MS/MS (CID-tandem MS) data interpreted by a publicly available software GlycopeptideId. Released glycans from the same sample was also analyzed with MALDI-MS. We have identified the N-glycoproteome of urinary exosomes. In total 126 N-glycopeptides from 51 N-glycosylation sites belonging to 37 glycoproteins were found in our results. The peptide sequences of these N-glycopeptides were identified unambiguously and their glycan composition (for 125 N-glycopeptides) and structures (for 87 N-glycopeptides) were proposed. A corresponding glycomic analysis with released N-glycans was also performed. We identified 66 unique nonmodified N-glycan compositions and in addition 13 sulfated/phosphorylated glycans were also found. This is the first systematic analysis of N-glycoproteome of urinary exosomes.

25447177,"Blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) are typically the first insects to arrive at human remains and carrion. Predictable succession patterns and known larval development of necrophagous insects on vertebrate remains can assist a forensic entomologist with estimates of a minimum post-mortem interval (PMImin) range. However, adult blow flies are infrequently used to estimate the PMImin, but rather are used for a confirmation of larval species identification. Cuticular hydrocarbons have demonstrated potential for estimating adult blow fly age, as hydrocarbons are present throughout blow fly development, from egg to adult, and are stable structures. The goal of this study was to identify hydrocarbon profiles associated with the adults of a North American native blow fly species, Cochliomyia macellaria (Fabricius) and a North American invasive species, Chrysomya rufifacies (Macquart). Flies were reared at a constant temperature (25°C), a photoperiod of 14:10 (L:D) (h), and were provided water, sugar and powdered milk ad libitum. Ten adult females from each species were collected at day 1, 5, 10, 20, and 30 post-emergence. Hydrocarbon compounds were extracted and then identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. A total of 37 and 35 compounds were detected from C. macellaria and Ch. rufifacies, respectively. There were 24 and 23 n-alkene and methyl-branched alkane hydrocarbons from C. macellaria and Ch. rufifacies, respectively (10 compounds were shared between species), used for statistical analysis. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis and permutational multivariate analysis of variance were used to analyze the hydrocarbon profiles with significant differences (P<0.001) detected among post-emergence age cohorts for each species, and unique hydrocarbon profiles detected as each adult blow fly species aged.

25429530,"Milk is a major food of global economic importance, and its consumption is regarded as a classic example of gene-culture evolution. Humans have exploited animal milk as a food resource for at least 8500 years, but the origins, spread, and scale of dairying remain poorly understood. Indirect lines of evidence, such as lipid isotopic ratios of pottery residues, faunal mortality profiles, and lactase persistence allele frequencies, provide a partial picture of this process; however, in order to understand how, where, and when humans consumed milk products, it is necessary to link evidence of consumption directly to individuals and their dairy livestock. Here we report the first direct evidence of milk consumption, the whey protein β-lactoglobulin (BLG), preserved in human dental calculus from the Bronze Age (ca. 3000 BCE) to the present day. Using protein tandem mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that BLG is a species-specific biomarker of dairy consumption, and we identify individuals consuming cattle, sheep, and goat milk products in the archaeological record. We then apply this method to human dental calculus from Greenland's medieval Norse colonies, and report a decline of this biomarker leading up to the abandonment of the Norse Greenland colonies in the 15(th) century CE.

We surveyed food intake and estimated the risk of exposures to aflatoxin and fumonisin mycotoxins for infants less than 6 months of age in Northern Tanzania. A total of 143 infants were progressively recruited and three follow-up visits were made at 1, 3 and 5 months of age. A 24-h dietary recall technique was used to estimate flour intake of infants who had been introduced to maize foods. Aflatoxins and fumonisins in the flours were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography technique. Exposure to aflatoxins or fumonisins was estimated using the deterministic approach. By the age of 3 months, 98 infants had started taking food; 67 of them, maize flours at levels ranging from 0.57 to 37.50 g per infant per day (average 8 g per infant per day). Fifty-eight per cent of 67 maize flour samples contained detectable aflatoxins (range 0.33-69.47 μg kg(-1) ; median 6 μg kg(-1) ) and 31% contained detectable fumonisins (range 48-1224 μg kg(-1) ; median 124 μg kg(-1) ).

With the proposed method, two types of SCF-based materials, phenylboronic acid grafted sulfhydryl cotton fiber (SCF-PBA) and zirconium phosphonate-modified sulfhydryl cotton fiber (SCF-pVPA-Zr(4+)), were successfully prepared. The grafted functional groups onto the thiol group of SCF were demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The prepared fibrous materials exhibited excellent fiber strength, good stability in aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, and great biocompatibility. Moreover, we developed filter-free in-pipet-tip SPE using these SCF-based materials as adsorbent for the enrichment of ribonucleosides, glycopeptides and phosphopeptides. Our results showed that SCF-PBA adsorbent can selectively capture ribonucleosides and glycopeptides from complex biological samples.

The calcium-binding capacity of Gly-Tyr reached 75.38 μg/mg, increasing by 122% when compared to the hydrolysate complex. The chelating interaction mode between the Gly-Tyr and calcium ion was investigated, indicating that the major binding sites included the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group and nitrogen of the amino or imino group. The folding and structural modification of the peptide arose along with the addition of the calcium ion. The profile of (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy demonstrated that the electron cloud density around the hydrogen nucleus in the peptide changed was caused by the calcium ion. The results of ζ potential showed that the Gly-Tyr-Ca chelate was a neutral molecule in which the calcium ion was surrounded by the specific binding sites of the peptide. Moreover, thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) and calcium-releasing assay revealed that the Gly-Tyr-Ca chelate exerted excellent thermal stability and solubility in both acidic and basic conditions, which were beneficial to calcium absorption in the gastrointestinal tract of the human body and, therefore, improved its bioavailability. These findings further the progress in the research of whey protein, suggesting the potential in making peptide-calcium chelate as a dietary supplement.

25208800,"Breast milk is regarded as an ideal source of nutrients for the growth and development of neonates, but it can also be a potential source of pollutants. Mothers can be exposed to different contaminants as a result of their lifestyle and environmental pollution. Mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As) could adversely affect the development of fetal and neonatal nervous system. Some fish and shellfish are rich in selenium (Se), an essential trace element that forms part of several enzymes related to the detoxification process, including glutathione S-transferase (GST). The goal of this study was to determine the interaction between Hg, As and Se and analyze its effect on the activity of GST in breast milk. Milk samples were collected from women between day 7 and 10 postpartum. The GST activity was determined spectrophotometrically; total Hg, As and Se concentrations were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. To explain the possible association of Hg, As and Se concentrations with GST activity in breast milk, generalized linear models were constructed. The model explained 44% of the GST activity measured in breast milk. The GLM suggests that GST activity was positively correlated with Hg, As and Se concentrations. The activity of the enzyme was also explained by the frequency of consumption of marine fish and shellfish in the diet of the breastfeeding women.

25205335,"Protein intake is essential for growth and repair of body cells, the normal functioning of muscles, and health related immune functions. Most food proteins are consumed after undergoing various degrees of processing. Changes in protein structure and assembly as a result of processing impact the digestibility of proteins. Research in understanding to what extent the protein structure impacts the rate of proteolysis under human physiological conditions has gained considerable interest. In this work, four whey protein gels were prepared using heat processing at two different pH values, 6.8 and 4.6, with and without applied shear. The gels showed different protein network microstructures due to heat induced unfolding (at pH 6.8) or lack of unfolding, thus resulting in fine stranded protein networks. When shear was applied during heating, particulate protein networks were formed. The differences in the gel microstructures resulted in considerable differences in their rheological properties. An in vitro gastric and intestinal model was used to investigate the resulting effects of these different gel structures on whey protein digestion. In addition, the rate of digestion was monitored by taking samples at various time points throughout the in vitro digestion process. The peptides in the digesta were profiled using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, reversed-phase-HPLC and LC-MS. Under simulated gastric conditions, whey proteins in structured gels were hydrolysed faster than native proteins in solution. The rate of peptides released during in vitro digestion differed depending on the structure of the gels and extent of protein aggregation. The outcomes of this work highlighted that changes in the network structure of the protein can influence the rate and pattern of its proteolysis under gastrointestinal conditions. Such knowledge could assist the food industry in designing novel food formulations to control the digestion kinetics and the release of biologically active peptides for desired health outcome.

The levels of contaminants in the samples from the official control were below maximum limits from EU regulations with only a few exceptions in the following groups; dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) in fish-containing byproducts and dioxins in vegetable and animal fat, hydrogen cyanide in linseed, and cadmium in sunflowers. The levels of pesticides and mycotoxins in the additionally collected samples were below maximum limits. Enniatin B (ENN B) was present in all DDGS samples. The hypothetical cases of carry-over of contamination from these byproducts were designed assuming total absorption and accumulation of the ingested contaminant in meat and milk and high exposure (a byproduct formed 15-20% of the feed ration depending on the species). The risk assessment was refined based on literature data on metabolism in relevant animal species. Risk assessment of contaminants in byproducts is generally based on a worst-case approach, as data on carry-over of a contaminant are sparse. This may lead to erroneous estimation of health hazards. The presence of ENN B in all samples of DDGS indicates that potential impact of this emerging mycotoxin on feed and food safety deserves attention.

25150706,"A comparative analysis of erythrocyte membrane proteins of economically important animals, goat (Capra aegagrus hircus), buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), pig (Sus scrofa), cow (Bos tauras), and human (Homo sapiens) was performed. Solubilized erythrocyte membrane proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), visualized by staining the gels with Commassie Brilliant Blue (CBB), and identified by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS). Emerging results show that all major erythrocyte membrane proteins present in human are also seen in all the animals except for band 4.5 which could not be identified. Band 3 is seen as more intense and compact, band 4.1 appears as a doublet in all the animal erythrocyte membranes, band 4.2 exhibits a slightly higher molecular weight (Mr) in buffalo, and cow and band 4.9 has a higher Mr in all the animals relative to the human protein. In addition, there are two new bands in the goat membrane, band G1, identified as HSP 90α, and band G2 identified as HSP 70. A new band C2 identified as HSP 70 is also seen in cow membranes. Peroxiredoxin II is of lower intensity and/or higher Mr in the animals. The difference in size of the proteins possibly indicates the variations in the composition of the amino acids. The difference in intensity of the proteins among these mammalians highlights the presence of less or more number of copies of that protein per cell. This data complement the earlier observations of differences in the sialoglycoprotein profile and effect of proteases and neuraminidase on agglutination among the mammalian erythrocytes. This study provides a platform to understand the molecular architecture of the individual erythrocytes, and in turn the dependent disorders, their phylogenetic relationship and also generates a database of erythrocyte membrane proteins of mammals.

Heavy metal concentrations in foodstuffs and human blood (adults (18-above) and children (1-12 years)) were analyzed using atomic absorption spectrometer. The results revealed high level of Mn in foodstuffs followed by Cr>Cu>Zn>Ni>Cd>Pb, which significantly increased the levels of heavy metals in the adult׳s blood as compared to that of children in the order of Cr>Zn>Mn>Ni>Pb>Cu>Cd. Principal component analysis showed that selected foodstuffs were the possible sources of metal contamination in human blood, while correlation analysis revealed that the concentrations of Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn in foodstuffs significantly correlated with that in human blood. Moreover, risk assessments for individual metals via foodstuffs were found within safe limits, except for Cd (HQ>1); Whereas, for aggregate multiple metals the risk was calculated as 3.97E+00 (HI>1), in which water and milk were perceived as the greater contributors (81 percent) to HI; while fruits, grains and vegetables contributed 5 percent each, and pulses 4 percent.

Beta-casomorphin 7 (BCM7) has been demonstrated to be enzymatically released from the A1 or B β-casein variant. Epidemiological evidence suggests the peptide BCM 7 is a risk factor for development of human diseases, including increased risk of type 1 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases but this has not been thoroughly substantiated by research studies. High performance liquid chromatography coupled to UV-Vis and mass spectrometry detection as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been used to analyze BCMs in dairy products. BCMs have been detected in raw cow's milk and human milk and a variety of commercial cheeses, but their presence has yet to be confirmed in commercial yoghurts. The finding that BCMs are present in cheese suggests they could also form in yoghurt, but be degraded during yoghurt processing. Whether BCMs do form in yoghurt and the amount of BCM forming or degrading at different processing steps needs further investigation and possibly will depend on the heat treatment and fermentation process used, but it remains an intriguing unknown.

Binding rhodamine B (RhB) to gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) resulted in quenching of the fluorescence of RhB by a resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism, with Au NPs as the energy acceptors. The presence of TCs caused the release of RhB molecules and recovered their fluorescence, and this was used as a basis for the quantitative determination of TCs. The reaction was monitored spectrofluorimetrically by measuring the increase in fluorescence of RhB at 572 nm starting 5 min after mixing the reagents in Tris buffer solution (pH 6.5).

Protein identification by 1DE coupled with LC-MS/MS analyses resulted in 1400 and 1287 proteins from the bovine (PM221) and human (ATCC12228) strains, respectively, covering over 50% of all predicted and more than 30% of all predicted surfome proteins in both strains. Comparison of the identification results suggests elevated levels of proteins involved in adherence, biofilm formation, signal transduction, house-keeping functions, and immune evasion in PM221, whereas ATCC12228 was more effective in expressing host defense evasion proteases, skin adaptation lipases, hemagglutination, and heavy-metal resistance proteins. Phenotypic analyses showed that only PM221 displays protein- and DNA-mediated adherent growth, and that PM221 was more efficient in cleaving tributyrin, a natural compound of milk fat under low CO2 conditions. These findings are in line with the identification data and suggest that distinct expression of lipases and adhesive surfome proteins could lead to the observed phenotypes.

24810963,"Oligosaccharides are the third largest component in human milk. This abundance is remarkable because oligosaccharides are not digestible by the newborn, and yet they have been conserved and amplified during evolution. In addition to encouraging the growth of a protective microbiota dominated by bifidobacteria, oligosaccharides have anti-infective activity, preventing pathogens from binding to intestinal cells. Although it would be advantageous adding these valuable molecules to infant milk formula, the technologies to reproduce the variety and complexity of human milk oligosaccharides by enzymatic/organic synthesis are not yet mature. Consequently, there is an enormous interest in alternative sources of these valuable oligosaccharides. Recent research has demonstrated that bovine milk and whey permeate also contain oligosaccharides. Thus, a thorough characterization of oligosaccharides in bovine dairy streams is an important step towards fully assessing their specific functionalities. In this study, bovine milk oligosaccharides (BMOs) were concentrated by membrane filtration from a readily available dairy stream called ""mother liquor"", and analyzed by high accuracy MALDI FT-ICR mass spectrometry. The combination of HPLC and accurate mass spectrometry allowed the identification of ideal processing conditions leading to the production of Kg amount of BMO enriched powders. Among the BMOs identified, 18 have high-molecular weight and corresponded in size to the most abundant oligosaccharides present in human milk. Notably 6 oligosaccharides contained fucose, a sugar monomer that is highly abundant in human milk, but is rarely observed in bovine milk. This work shows that dairy streams represent a potential source of complex milk oligosaccharides for commercial development of unique dairy ingredients in functional foods that reproduce the benefits of human milk.

Accidental feeding of aflatoxin-contaminated rice straw may be detrimental for ruminant livestock and can lead to transmission of this toxin or its metabolites into the milk of dairy cattle. White-rot basidiomycetous fungus Pleurotus ostreatus produces ligninolytic enzymes like laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP). These extracellular enzymes have been reported to degrade many environmentally hazardous compounds. The present study examines the ability of P. ostreatus strains to degrade AFB1 in rice straw in the presence of metal salts and surfactants. Laccase and MnP activities were determined spectrophotometrically. The efficiency of AFB1 degradation was evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography. Highest degradation was recorded for both P. ostreatus MTCC 142 (89.14 %) and P. ostreatus GHBBF10 (91.76 %) at 0.5 µg mL(-1) initial concentration of AFB1.

The hydrolysates of MRP were obtained from fermentation by lactic acid bacteria (LAB; i.e., Lactobacillus gasseri H10, L. gasseri H11, Lactobacillus fermentum H4, and L. fermentum H9, where human-isolated strains were designated H1 to H15), which had excellent proteolytic and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activities (>20%). The antioxidant activity of MRP was greater than that of intact proteins in assays of the reaction with 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt and trivalent ferric ions; moreover, the effect of MRP was synergistically improved by fermentation. The Maillard reaction dramatically increased the level of antithrombotic activity and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) inhibitory effect of milk proteins, but did not change the level of activity for micellar cholesterol solubility. Furthermore, specific biological properties were enhanced by fermentation. Lactobacillus gasseri H11 demonstrated the greatest activity for thrombin and HMGR inhibition in Maillard-reacted WPC, by 42 and 33%, respectively, whereas hydrolysates of Maillard-reacted SC fermented by L. fermentum H9 demonstrated the highest reduction rate for micellar cholesterol solubility, at 52%.

At equal energy intake and apparent fat and nitrogen digestibility, mice fed HF whey stored less energy as lipids, evident both as lower white adipose tissue mass and as reduced liver lipids, compared with HF-casein-fed mice. Explorative analyses of 48 h urine, both by (1)H NMR and LC-MS metabolomic platforms, demonstrated higher urinary excretion of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates citric acid and succinic acid (identified by both platforms), and cis-aconitic acid and isocitric acid (identified by LC-MS platform) in the HF whey, relative to in the HF-casein-fed mice. Targeted LC-MS analyses revealed higher citric acid and cis-aconitic acid concentrations in fed state plasma, but not in liver of HF-whey-fed mice. We propose that enhanced urinary loss of TCA cycle metabolites drain available substrates for anabolic processes, such as lipogenesis, thereby leading to reduced lipid accretion in HF-whey-fed compared to HF-casein-fed mice.

24699806,"In vitro digestion of isolated milk proteins results in milk peptides with a variety of actions. However, it remains unclear to what degree protein degradation occurs in vivo in the infant stomach and whether peptides previously annotated for bioactivity are released. This study combined nanospray LC separation with time-of-flight mass spectrometry, comprehensive structural libraries, and informatics to analyze milk from 3 human mothers and the gastric aspirates from their 4- to 12-d-old postpartum infants. Milk from the mothers contained almost 200 distinct peptides, demonstrating enzymatic degradation of milk proteins beginning either during lactation or between milk collection and feeding. In the gastric samples, 649 milk peptides were identified, demonstrating that digestion continues in the infant stomach. Most peptides in both the intact milk and gastric samples were derived from β-casein. The numbers of peptides from β-casein, lactoferrin, α-lactalbumin, lactadherin, κ-casein, serum albumin, bile salt-associated lipase, and xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase were significantly higher in the gastric samples than in the milk samples (P < 0.05). A total of 603 peptides differed significantly in abundance between milk and gastric samples (P < 0.05). Most of the identified peptides have previously identified biologic activity.

24694256,"A key element in understanding how human milk proteins support the health and development of the neonate is to understand how individual proteins are affected during digestion. In the present study, a dynamic gastric model was used to simulate infant gastric digestion of human milk, and a subsequent proteomic approach was applied to study the behavior of individual proteins. A total of 413 human milk proteins were quantified in this study. This approach demonstrated a high degree of variability in the susceptibility of human milk proteins to gastric digestion. Specifically this study reports that lipoproteins are among the class of slowly digested proteins during gastric processes. The levels of integral lysozyme C and partial lactadherin in milk whey increase over digestion. Mucins, ribonuclease 4, and macrophage mannose receptor 1 are also resistant to gastric digestion. The retention or enhancement in whey protein abundance can be ascribed to the digestive release of milk-fat-globule-membrane or immune-cell enclosed proteins that are not initially accessible in milk. Immunoglobulins are more resistant to digestion compared to total milk proteins, and within the immunoglobulin class IgA and IgM are more resistant to digestion compared to IgG.

Sulfanilamide antibiotic was extracted and determined via the developed method followed by high performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). The extraction process was carried out by rapid shooting of acetonitrile as extraction solvent (syringe B) into saline aqueous sample solution (syringe A), and then the shooting was repeated several times at a rate of 1 cycles(-1).

The functionalization of polymeric backbone after its development brings unique selectivity towards the target biomolecules. In present work, the functionalities of choice have been introduced through the ring-opening of allyl glycidyl ether. The utility of polymer is widened through derivatizations to immobilized metal ion affinity chromatographic (IMAC) material for the phosphopeptides enrichment and Reversed Phase (C-18) for the desalting prior to MALDI-MS analysis. The polymer-IMAC in addition to Fe(3+) is also immobilized with lanthanide ions like La(3+), Eu(3+), and Er(3+). The amount of Fe(3+) immobilized is determined as 0.7928 mg/g. Spherical morphology with narrow particle size dispersion is revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The surface area, pore volume and size distribution is determined by nitrogen adsorption porosimetery. The elemental composition and purity level is confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) data. The derivatization to IMAC and RP is evaluated by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The polymer enables the efficient phosphopeptide enrichment to equal degree from casein variants, non-fat milk, egg yolk, human serum, and HeLa cell extract. The identification of phosphorylation sites can lead to the phosphorylation pathways to understand the post-translational modifications. The identification with their sequence coverage is made using Mascot and Phosphosite Plus. It is sensitive to enrich the phosphopeptides down to 2 femtomoles with very high selectivity of 1:2000 with BSA background. These attributes are linked to the higher surface area (173.1554 m(2)/g) of the designed polymer. The non-specific bindings, particularly the Fe(3+) linked acidic residues are also avoided. Four characteristic phosphopeptides (fibrinopeptide A and their hydrolytic products) from fibrinogen α-chain are identified from the human serum after the enrichment, which have link to the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Milk withheld for sale because of drug treatment or from cows with high somatic cell counts is commonly called ""waste milk."" One-third of dairy farms in the United States use waste milk to feed preweaned dairy calves. Limited information is currently available on the effect of this practice on the selection and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Pooled waste milk samples were collected from 34 dairy farms in central New York State with the objective of detecting the presence and quantity of drug residues in these samples. Samples were collected and refrigerated using ice packs and then stored at 4°C upon arrival at the Cornell laboratory (Ithaca, NY). Screening for β-lactam, tetracycline, and sulfonamide residues in the milk was performed using commercial enzyme-linked receptor-binding assay (SNAP) tests (Idexx Laboratories Inc., Westbrook, ME). Samples with a positive SNAP test were selected for screening using a multiresidue liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. The SNAP tests revealed that 75, 14.3, and 7.1% of waste milk samples (n=34) contained β-lactam, tetracycline, and sulfamethazine residues, respectively.

24372141,"Milk protein of farm animals is difficult to isolate because of the presence of casein micelles, which are hard to separate from whey by using centrifugation or filtration. Insoluble casein micelles also create an obstacle for purification instruments to operate efficiently. The conventional method, to precipitate caseins by lowering pH to 4.6 and then recover the whey fraction for further purification using chromatography techniques, is not applicable to proteins having an isoelectric point similar to caseins. In addition, the acid condition used for casein removal usually leads to significantly poor yields and reduced biological activities. In this study, a novel method of precipitating caseins under neutral or weak acidic conditions is presented. The method employs a phosphate salt and a freeze-thaw procedure to obtain a casein-free whey protein fraction. This fraction contains more than 90% yield with little loss of bioactivity of the target protein, and is readily available for further chromatographic purification.

The research was carried out on hair sampled from 267 young adults living in Wrocław (southwest Poland). The effect of the place of residence, diet, and lifestyle on lead content in hair was examined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Lead was determined at the wavelength 220.353 nm. These outcomes were reached by linking the results of lead level in hair with the results of questionnaire survey. The mean lead level in hair of the whole examined population was 2.01 ± 2.10 mg kg(-1). Lead can enter the human body mainly by inhalation and gastrointestinal absorption. It was found that consuming cheese, fish, and lettuce caused increased level of lead in hair. On the other hand, drinking of milk, tea, coffee, or lemon resulted in decreased content of lead in hair.

Human milk contains hundreds of endogenous peptides, and the ensemble has been documented for antimicrobial actions. Naturally occurring peptides from bovine milk were sequenced and compared with human milk peptides. Bovine milk samples from six cows in second-stage peak lactation at 78-121 days postpartum revealed 159 peptides. Most peptides (73%) were found in all six cows sampled, demonstrating the similarity of the intramammary peptide degradation across these cows. One peptide sequence, ALPIIQKLEPQIA from bovine perilipin 2, was identical to another found in human milk. Most peptides derived from β-casein, αs1-casein, and αs2-casein. No peptides derived from abundant bovine milk proteins such as lactoferrin, β-lactoglobulin, and secretory immunoglobulin A.

The enzyme catalyzed trans-sialylation using either 2-O-(p-nitrophenyl)-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid or casein glycomacropeptide (whey protein) as the sialyl donor and lactose as the acceptor, resulting in production of both 3'-sialyllactose and 6'-sialyllactose. This is the first study reporting α-2,6-trans-sialidase activity of this sialyltransferase (EC 2.4.99.1 and 2.4.99.4). A response surface design was used to evaluate the effects of three reaction parameters (pH, temperature, and lactose concentration) on enzymatic production of 3'- and 6'-sialyllactoses using 5% (w/v) casein glycomacropeptide (equivalent to 9mM bound sialic acid) as the donor. The maximum yield of 3'-sialyllactose (2.75±0.35mM) was achieved at a reaction condition with pH 6.4, 40°C, 100mM lactose after 6h; and the largest concentration of 6'-sialyllactose (3.33±0.38mM) was achieved under a condition with pH 5.4, 40°C, 100mM lactose after 8h. 6'-sialyllactose was presumably formed from α-2,3 bound sialic acid in the casein glycomacropeptide as well as from 3'-sialyllactose produced in the reaction. The kcat/Km value for the enzyme using 3'-sialyllactose as the donor for 6'-sialyllactose synthesis at pH 5.4 and 40°C was determined to be 23.22±0.7M(-1)s(-1).

24200020,"Milk contains a wide array of compounds with established or putative pro- or anti-oxidant function. The functions of these compounds have been intensively studied. This review focusses on some important aspects in this wide field namely the methodology for measurement of the total antioxidant capacity (TAC), the content of TAC and some related compounds in human and animal milks and infant formulas, and the effect of milk intake on antioxidant status in the body and on the activity of dietary flavonoids as studied in vitro and in vivo. Regarding methodology TAC in milk can be measured by spectrophotometric and electrochemical methods and some of their characteristics are reviewed. Milk, whey, high-molecular-weight and low-molecular-weight (LMW) fractions of whey have all been found to have antioxidant capacity using these techniques. The major antioxidant in the LMW fraction has been identified as urate. An extensive literature survey was made regarding data on the antioxidant capacity and related variables of milk obtained from different sources (human milk, infant formulas and animal milk) and subjected to different treatments. Differences in TAC between milks from different sources have been observed but due to the variety of techniques used no clear pattern is evident at present. Another important aspect is the putative effects of the intake of milk products on the antioxidant status of the consumer. A few studies performed in adults and premature infants are reviewed and it is stated that too little information is available to make any firm conclusions in this regard. Finally, a high interest has been devoted to the possible interference of milk with the antioxidant properties of flavonoid-rich food like tea. Most in vitro studies show an inhibition by milk on tea flavonoid activity whereas the results from the corresponding in vivo studies are equivocal. Our general conclusion is that several compounds in various milk fractions contribute to the antioxidant capacity of milk and that much further work is needed to unravel the complex interactions among the pro- and antioxidants, and their putative health effects on the consumer.","Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)","['D000818', 'D000975', 'D055664', 'D005419', 'D006801', 'D041943', 'D007231', 'D008892', 'D008895', 'D018384', 'D013053']","['Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Electrochemical Techniques', 'Flavonoids', 'Humans', 'Infant Formula', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Milk', 'Milk, Human', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Spectrophotometry']",The antioxidant capacity of milk--the application of different methods in vitro and in vivo.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000187', None]","[None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'drug effects', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24200020,2014,0

Several certified reference materials (CRMs) were also included in the sample set for comparison purposes. For these CRMs, the isotopic composition of Zn is expressed as δ-values, calculated with respect to both IRMM-3702 and JMC-ZnLyon, as isotopic standards. The range of δ(66)Zn values observed in food products was approximately 1.9‰. In general, vegetables, cereals and derived products showed an enrichment of the heavier Zn isotopes, whereas a depletion was observed in products of animal origin (meat, fish, egg and semi-skimmed milk), relative to human blood samples. Mussel, however, showed a significant enrichment of the heavier isotopes, which is hypothetically attributed to its accumulation behaviour. Thus, the lower δ(66)Zn values found in food products of animal origin appear to be reflected in the lower δ(66)Zn value observed in blood from an omnivorous population compared to that for a vegetarian population.

24140321,"Bovine milk is an agricultural product of tremendous value worldwide. It contains proteins, fat, lactose, vitamins, and minerals. It provides nutrition and immunological protection (e.g., in the gastrointestinal tract) to the newborn and young calf. It also forms an important part of human nutrition. The repertoire of proteins in milk (i.e., its proteome) is vast and complex. The milk proteome can be described in detail by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. However, the high concentration of dominating proteins in milk reduces mass spectrometry detection sensitivity and limits detection of low abundant proteins. Further, the general health and udder health of the dairy cows delivering the milk may influence the composition of the milk proteome. To gain a more exhaustive and true picture of the milk proteome, we performed an extensive preanalysis fractionation of raw composite milk collected from documented healthy cows in early lactation. Four simple and industrially applicable techniques exploring the physical and chemical properties of milk, including acidification, filtration, and centrifugation, were used for separation of the proteins. This resulted in 5 different fractions, whose content of proteins were compared with the proteins of nonfractionated milk using 2-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis. To validate the proteome analysis, spectral counts and ELISA were performed on 7 proteins using the ELISA for estimation of the detection sensitivity limit of the 2-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Each fractionation technique resulted in identification of a unique subset of proteins. However, high-speed centrifugation of milk to whey was by far the best method to achieve high and repeatable proteome coverage. The total number of milk proteins initially detected in nonfractionated milk and the fractions were 635 in 2 replicates. Removal of dominant proteins and filtering for redundancy across the different fractions reduced the number to 376 unique proteins in 2 replicates. In addition, 366 proteins were detected by this process in 1 replicate. Hence, by applying different fractionation techniques to milk, we expanded the milk proteome. The milk proteome map may serve as a reference for scientists working in the dairy sector.

24139905,"α-Lactalbumin (α-la) is a major whey protein found in milk. Previous data suggested that α-la has antiproliferative effects in human adenocarcinoma cell lines such as Caco-2 and HT-29. However, the cell death inducing α-la was not a naturally occurring monomer but either a multimeric variant or an α-la:oleic acid complex (HAMLET/BAMLET). Proteolysis showed that both human and bovine α-la are susceptible to digestion. ELISA assays assessing cell death with the native undigested α-la fractions showed that undigested protein fractions did have a significant cell death effect on CaCo-2 cells. Bovine α-la was also more effective than human α-la. A reduction in activity corresponded with lower concentrations of the protein and partial digestion and fragmentation of the protein using trypsin and pepsin.

Then the third peak (peak III) was identified with Western-Blot method and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight/time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS). The identification of Western-Blot showed that peak III can combine with the specificity of human milk beta-casein antibody, and it is proved to be human milk beta-casein. The fingerprints of peak III were nalyzed by Mascot searching, and the sequence coverage was 50%, further supporting it is human milk beta-casein.

The phosphopeptide analysis strategies developed in this study were all at microscale. After using a standard microwave oven to assist protein digestion, phosphoserine and phosphothreonine were tagged with chemical analogues, such as 2-mercaptoethanol and 3-mercapto-1-propanol, to enable simultaneously relative quantitation and identification. This method enabled the use of thio alcohols for direct labeling of phosphorylated sites (not labeled at the mercapto, amino, hydroxyl, or carboxyl groups) of phosphopeptides. Various digestion parameters (e.g., microwave power, reaction time, NH4HCO3 concentration) and derivatization efficiency parameters (e.g., reaction time, labeling tag concentration) were studied and optimized. In both control and experimental samples, microwave-assisted digestion coupled with relative quantitation using analogue tags enabled calculation of phosphopeptide ratios in the same sequence. A non-labeling method was also established for quantifying phosphopeptides in human plasma by using the abundant protein albumin as an internal control for normalizing relative quantities of phosphopeptides. Nano ultra-performance liquid chromatography (nanoUPLC) was combined with LTQ Orbitrap to enable simultaneous protein relative quantitation and identification.

23949006,"Aflatoxin-producing fungi contaminate food and feed during pre-harvest, storage and processing periods. Once consumed, aflatoxins (AFs) accumulate in tissues, causing illnesses in animals and humans. Most human exposure to AF seems to be a result of consumption of contaminated plant and animal products. The policy of blending and dilution of grain containing higher levels of aflatoxins with uncontaminated grains for use in animal feed implicitly assumes that the deleterious effects of low levels of the toxins are linearly correlated to concentration. This assumption may not be justified, since it involves extrapolation of these nontoxic levels in feed, which are not of further concern. To develop a better understanding of the significance of low dose effects, in the present study, we developed quantitative methods for the detection of biologically active aflatoxin B₁ (AFB1) in Vero cells by two independent assays: the green fluorescent protein (GFP) assay, as a measure of protein synthesis by the cells, and the microculture tetrazolium (MTT) assay, as a measure of cell viability. The results demonstrate a non-linear dose-response relationship at the cellular level. AFB1 at low concentrations has an opposite biological effect to higher doses that inhibit protein synthesis. Additional studies showed that heat does not affect the stability of AFB1 in milk and that the Vero cell model can be used to determine the presence of bioactive AFB1 in spiked beef, lamb and turkey meat.

Because the mammary glands are unable to synthesize TFA, it is likely that the TFA in human milk come from dietary intake. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the sources of TFA intake for lactating mothers in one of the urban areas in Selangor. In this cross-sectional study, anthropometric measurements, FFQ including 7 food groups and dietary consumption data were collected from 101 lactating mothers. Five major TFA isomers (palmitoelaidic acid (16:1t9), petroselaidic acid (18:1t6), elaidic acid (18:1t9), vaccenic acid (18:1t11) and linoelaidic acid (18:2t9,12) in human milk were measured by gas chromatography (GC). The relationship between food consumption and TFA levels was assessed using the non-parametric Spearman's rho test. The TFA content in human milk was 2.94±0.96 (SEM) % fatty acid; this is considered low, as it is lower than 4%. The most abundant TFA isomer was linoelaidic acid (1.44±0.60% fatty acid). A sub-experiment (analyzing 3 days of composite food consumption) was conducted with 18 lactating mothers, and the results showed that linoelaidic acid was the most common TFA consumed (0.07±0.01 g/100 g food).

WP and whey permeate enzymatically treated (WP-GOS) were used as culture media of Lactobacillus plantarum 299v. Lb. plantarum 299v attained the stationary phase in approximately 16 h, reaching 3·6 and 4·1×108 CFU/ml in WP and WP-GOS, respectively. The in situ synthesised GOS were not consumed during growth. No significant differences were observed in the growth kinetics of microorganisms in both media. After fermentation, microorganisms were dehydrated by freeze-drying and spray-drying and stored. The recovery of microorganisms after fermentation, dehydration and storage at 4 °C for at least 120 d was above 108 CFU/g. These studies demonstrated that WP is an appropriate substrate for the synthesis of GOS and the obtained product is also adequate as culture medium of Lb. plantarum 299v.

23859835,"Hydroxytyrosol (HXT) has been reported to have beneficial effects for human health, such as antioxidant and antimicrobial properties and an important contribution to the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Hence, exhaustive research is currently being performed to prepare functional foods, such as tomato juice or milk, with HXT. This paper presents a multi-commutated flow method based on the quenching effect that HXT has on the fluorescence of water-soluble mercaptopropionic acid-capped CdTe quantum dots. Under optimal conditions a linear working range was obtained for concentrations between 10 and 250 ng µl⁻¹. In order to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed method for the determination of HXT, HXT-enriched samples were prepared. Using a QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) procedure for extraction, HXT was determined in the prepared functional foods (milk, infant formula, tomato juice and tomato soup). Recoveries of 100% ± 8%, relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 5% and high sample throughput of 70 samples per h show the potential of the system for the analysis of HXT in food samples.","Food additives & contaminants.

The in silico analysis of the tryptic peptides based on LC-CID-MS/MS facilitated the identification of protein as β-lg. The sequences IIVTQ f[1-5] and LSFNPTQLEEQCHV f(149-162) of m/z 933(+) and 851(2+) were found to match N- and C-extreme of β-lg while IDALNENK f(84-91) and TPEVDDEALEKFDK f(125-138) sequences deduced for m/z 916(+) and 818(2+) were in compliance to buffalo milk β-lg. Considering the sequence similarity of β-lg to glycodelin, a proven angiogenic protein, similar role for β-lg from buffalo colostrum (BLG-col) was examined. Interestingly, BLG-col exhibited anti-angiogenic activity by potently inhibiting cell proliferation, micro-vessel sprouting, cell migration and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a dose-dependent manner but having varied effect on Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, MCF-7, MDA-MB 435 and MDA-MB 231 cell lines. The anti-angiogenic potential of BLG-col was found to be vascular endothelial growth factor mediated. The immunolocalisation of BLG-col on the cell surface of HUVECs evidenced using FITC-labelled β-lg antibody indicated its extra-cellular binding. Furthermore, BLG-col interacting HUVEC membrane protein (64 kDa) was detected by immunoblot and its identity was established by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis, which showed peptide sequence homology to G protein-coupled receptor kinase 4.

Although a large number of metals are introduced to the water bodies during their mining and extraction processes and geochemical weathering of rocks, but the role of domestic and industrial wastes is predominant and of much concern. Increased industrial activities has increased the incidence of percolation of toxic metal ions to the soil and water bodies and presently their presence in ecosystem, have reached to an alarming level that environmentalists are finding it difficult to enforce control measures. Human activities and large number of small and big industrial units are increasingly discharging deleterious metals present in the effluents and wastes, to the environment and aquatic systems and have contaminated heavily even the ground water. The toxic metals have a great tendency of bioaccumulation through which they enter the food chain system and ultimately affect adversely the life on this planet Earth in various ways. Further, due to contamination of irrigation system by the harmful Chemicals and toxic metals, the farm products, vegetables, fruits, potable water and even milk is not spared.

DPP-IV inhibitors have emerged as new and promising oral agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of β-lactoglobulin as natural source of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides. A whey protein concentrate rich in β-lactoglobulin was hydrolysed with trypsin and fractionated using a chromatographic separation at semipreparative scale. Two of the six collected fractions showed notable DPP-IV inhibitory activity.

23790854,"The presence of β-lactam residues in foodstuffs constitutes a potential risk to the human health and undesirable effects on consumers, and nowadays these antibiotic residues are also recognised as an emerging environmental problem. In addition, these are of great concern to prestigious Manchego cheese processors (Central Spain denomination of origin) because they reduce the curdling of milk and cause improper cheese ripening, which consequently lead to an important loss of monetary income. This work describes the development of a sensitive and reliable method using liquid chromatography with UV-diode array detection (LC-DAD) for simultaneous determination of the β-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin (AMP), benzylpenicillin (PEG), cephalexin (CFX), cefazolin (CFL), cefoperazone (CFP), cloxacillin (CLO), dicloxacillin (DCL), oxacillin (OXA) and phenoxymethylpenicillin (PEV), in Manchega ewe milk. The column, mobile phase, temperature and flow rate were optimised to provide the best resolution of these analytes. The extraction method of the antibiotic residues involves the deproteinisation of the milk sample using acetonitrile and centrifugation followed by a solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up. The recoveries for the studied β-lactams ranged from 79% to 96% with relative standard deviations between 0.5% and 4.9%. The limits of quantification (LOQs) for all these compounds were in the range of 3.4-8.6μgkg(-1), which are lower than the maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by the European Union for the studied β-lactams in milk, making the method suitable for performing routine analyses. The proposed multi-residue LC-UV-diode array detection (LC-DAD) method is a powerful and popular alternative for the determination and confirmation of antibiotic residues in small milk industries and is the first one capable of determining nine β-lactam antibiotics in samples of Manchega ewe milk.

Two initiatives were introduced in New Zealand to prevent deficiency: (1) mandatory fortification of bread with iodised salt; and (2) provision of a subsidised iodine supplement (150 μg) for all pregnant and breastfeeding women. The aim of this study was to assess iodine intake and status among a self-selecting sample of pregnant and lactating women in Palmerston North, both before and after the two initiatives. Pregnant and breastfeeding women were recruited before (n = 25 and 32; 2009) and after (n = 34 and 36; 2011) the initiatives. Iodine concentration was determined in 24-h urine and breast milk samples using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Use of supplements and salt, knowledge of iodine deficiency, and awareness of the initiatives were determined by questionnaire. Median urine iodine concentration (UIC) was higher in 2011 compared with 2009 for both pregnant (85 and 47 μg L(-1) ) and breastfeeding (74 and 34 μg L(-1) ) participants; median UIC were below the cut-offs for adequate iodine status. However, in 2011, the estimated daily iodine intake during pregnancy was 217 μg day(-1) ; 74% of women achieved the Estimated Average Requirement. Knowledge of the initiatives was low, only 28-56% were aware of the need for iodine supplements and only 15-22% were aware of the mandatory addition of iodised salt to bread. Despite initiatives, UIC of these women indicates iodine deficiency, however, dietary intakes appear adequate. Ongoing surveillance of supplement use and iodine status among pregnant and lactating women throughout New Zealand is needed to fully assess the efficacy of the initiatives.

Due to the different composition of cow and breast milk, these devices need to be validated against reference methods before they can be used in daily routine. However, current reference methods require a sample volume of 30-100 mL to analyse fat, protein and lactose. It is not feasible to obtain this volume of milk for research purposes, especially from VLBW infants as lactation may be delayed or impaired and the limited volume of breast milk must be provided to the infant. To support validation of milk analysers in both clinical and research settings, the aim of this study is to establish and validate micromethods for precise macronutrient analysis in small volume of breast milk and conduct a feasibility study of the micromethods as a post-validation. Methods include a modified Mojonnier ether extraction (fat), elemental analysis (protein) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lactose).

23674377,"Complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) can affect the pharmacokinetics of anticancer drugs by interacting with the metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. To evaluate changes in the activity of CYP3A4 in patients, levels of 1-hydroxymidazolam in plasma are often determined with liquid chromatography-quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). However, validated LC-MS/MS methods to determine in vitro CYP3A4 inhibition in human liver microsomes are scarce and not optimized for evaluating CYP3A4 inhibition by CAM. The latter is necessary because CAM are often complex mixtures of numerous compounds that can interfere with the selective measurement of 1-hydroxymidazolam. Therefore, the aim was to validate and optimize an LC-MS/MS method for the adequate determination of CYP3A4 inhibition by CAM in human liver microsomes. After incubation of human liver microsomes with midazolam, liquid-liquid extraction with tert-butyl methyl ether was applied and dried samples were reconstituted in 50% methanol. These samples were injected onto a reversed-phase chromatography consisting of a Zorbax Extend-C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm, 5.0 µm particle size), connected to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization.

In this study, we used CE-TOF-MS for separation and identification of bioactive peptides in three hypoallergenic infant milk formulas. An appropriate sample cleanup using a citrate buffer with DTT and urea followed by SPE with Sep-Pack® C18 and StrataX™ cartridges allowed the detection of a large number of low molecular mass bioactive peptides. This preliminary identification was solely based on the measured experimental monoisotopic molecular mass values (M(exp)). Later, we evaluated the classical semiempirical relationships between electrophoretic mobility and charge-to-mass ratio (m(e) vs. q/M(α), α = 1/2 for the classical polymer model) to describe their migration behavior. The assistance of migration prediction proved to be useful to improve reliability of the identification, avoiding misinterpretations and solving some identity conflicts. After revision, the identity of 24, 30, and 38 bioactive peptides was confirmed in each of the three infant milk formulas.

This manuscript describes the development of isotope-dilution liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry for 20 PTH-AA derivatives, and long-term stability testing of PTH-AAs to ensure quantitative quality in the reaction. The 20 corresponding [(13)C6]-PTH-AAs were prepared by use of a one-pot reaction involving a mixture of [(13)C6]-Edman reagent and 20 AAs. Good linearity was observed for standard curves for the PTH-AAs, using the corresponding [(13)C6]-PTH-AAs as internal standards (1-100 pmol per injection, r(2) = 0.989-1.000). Serum albumin (human), pepsin (porcine stomach mucosa), α-casein (bovine milk), ribonuclease A (bovine), lysozyme (chicken egg white), and insulin (bovine) subjected to Edman degradation were examined as model proteins and peptides for N-terminal AA analysis.

Understanding the amount of perchlorate exposure occurring through non-water sources is essential for accurate estimates of human exposure levels, and establishment of drinking water limits for this pervasive contaminant. The study objective was to determine the amount of perchlorate intake derived from diet rather than water. Subjects provided drinking water samples, detailed fluid-intake records, 24h urine collections and four milk samples for nine days. Samples were analyzed for perchlorate by isotope dilution ion chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Amounts of perchlorate derived from drinking water and dietary sources were calculated for each individual. Water of local origin was found to contribute a minor fraction of perchlorate intake. Estimated fraction intake from drinking water ranged from 0 to 36%. The mean and median dose of perchlorate derived from non-water sources by lactating women was 0.18 μg/kg/day (range: 0.06 to 0.36 μg/kg/day.) Lactating women consumed more fluid (mean 2.424 L/day) than has been assumed in recent risk assessments for perchlorate.

23215446,"Determining protein-specific glycosylation in protein mixtures remains a difficult task. A common approach is to use gel electrophoresis to isolate the protein followed by glycan release from the identified band. However, gel bands are often composed of several proteins. Hence, release of glycans from specific bands often yields products not from a single protein but a composite. As an alternative, we present an approach whereby glycans are released with peptide tags allowing verification of glycans bound to specific proteins. We term the process in-gel nonspecific proteolysis for elucidating glycoproteins (INPEG). INPEG combines rapid gel separation of a protein mixture with in-gel nonspecific proteolysis of protein bands followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of the resulting N- and O-glycopeptides. Here, in-gel digestion is shown for the first time with nonspecific and broad specific proteases such as Pronase, proteinase K, pepsin, papain, and subtilisin. Tandem MS analysis of the resulting glycopeptides separated on a porous graphitized carbon (PGC) chip was achieved via nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (nano-LC/Q-TOF MS). In this study, rapid and automated glycopeptide assignment was achieved via an in-house software (Glycopeptide Finder) based on a combination of accurate mass measurement, tandem MS data, and predetermined protein identification (obtained via routine shotgun analysis). INPEG is here initially validated for O-glycosylation (κ casein) and N-glycosylation (ribonuclease B).

Protein expression profile identification was performed, 37 proteins were specifically expressed in the TC animals and 70 protein spots that were classified as 22 proteins with significantly altered expression levels in the TC and C groups compared to N group. Assessment of the relationship of the transgene effect and normal variability in the milk protein profiles in each group indicated that the variation in the endogenous protein profiles of the three TC groups was within the limit of natural variability. More than 50 parameters for the colostrum and mature milk were compared between each TC group and the N controls. The data revealed essentially similar profiles for all groups.

Participants responded to a 24-h dietary recall questionnaire on the 74th and 76th day of lactation and to a Food Frequency Questionnaire querying the frequency of fish intake over the last 90 days. Usual intake was estimated using the PC-SIDE software package. A meal of fish was offered on the 75th day of lactation.

The multilevel mixed linear model used showed high heterogeneity of the mercury levels among the mothers, and THg levels did not change significantly over the period under study. However, a significant increase in THg levels was observed after the intervention with the fish meal. Exposure increased for most infants on the 90th day of lactation, with intakes exceeding the THg provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) at least once during the period for 77.8 % of samples. Mothers consumed mostly food from the fat and grain groups, and a significant correlation was detected between consumption of food of these groups and breast milk THg levels (p = 0.006 and 0.007). A significant correlation was also found between vegetable consumption and carbohydrate intake and THg levels in the samples (p = 0.015 and 0.045, respectively).

23083414,"Glycidyl esters (GEs) are known to be formed during vegetable oil processing. Because of their structure, it has been hypothesised that GEs, like fatty acid esters of chloropropanols (MCPD esters), may be accepted as substrates by gut lipases to release the epoxide glycidol. If confirmed such a hypothesis would be important for risk assessment since glycidol is considered as a genotoxic carcinogen. In the present study, biotransformation was investigated using static and dynamic gastrointestinal models. During the experiments, aliquots were analysed for non-digested GEs using liquid chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (LC-ToF-MS). In the static model, a fast hydrolysis of GEs was observed as a result of lipase action. Lipase was very efficient at pH 4.8, and totally inhibited at very low pH (1.7). In the absence of lipase, GEs were found to be relatively stable. The potential impact of food matrix was studied using milk in a dynamic model simulating human physiological conditions. The fast, pH-dependent hydrolysis of GEs was further confirmed. The possible transformation of the digestion products was then investigated using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), mainly the epoxide ring-opening to glycerol followed by additional reactions. In any conditions applied, neither 2- nor 3-mono-chloropropanediol (2- nor 3-MCPD) were formed, indicating that a ring-opening of the epoxide group of GEs or glycidol followed by a reaction with chloride was unlikely. A small transformation of glycidol into glycerol was observed after longer incubation time correlated with a low pH. This suggested that ring-opening and reaction with water is possible in strongly acidic conditions. Overall, it is concluded that GEs are rapidly digested by gut lipases to form glycidol. Consequently, GEs should be considered as sources of glycidol exposure. In addition, risk assessment of GEs can likely rely on hazard identification and characterisation data specific for glycidol.","Food additives & contaminants.

23068043,"Defining the biological roles of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOS) requires an efficient, simple, reliable, and robust analytical method for simultaneous quantification of oligosaccharide profiles from multiple samples. The HMOS fraction of milk is a complex mixture of polar, highly branched, isomeric structures that contain no intrinsic facile chromophore, making their resolution and quantification challenging. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method was devised to resolve and quantify 11 major neutral oligosaccharides of human milk simultaneously. Crude HMOS fractions are reduced, resolved by porous graphitic carbon high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a water/acetonitrile gradient, detected by mass spectrometric specific ion monitoring, and quantified. The HPLC separates isomers of identical molecular weights, allowing 11 peaks to be fully resolved and quantified by monitoring mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios of the deprotonated negative ions. The standard curves for each of the 11 oligosaccharides is linear from 0.078 or 0.156 to 20 μg/ml (R(2)>0.998). Precision (coefficient of variation) ranges from 1% to 9%. Accuracy is from 86% to 104%.

C1INH isolated from human blood plasma (pd-hC1INH) is used for the management of hereditary angioedema (HAE), a disease caused by heterozygous deficiency of C1INH, and is a promise for treatment of ischemia-reperfusion injuries like acute myocardial or cerebral infarction. To obtain large quantities of C1INH, recombinant human C1INH (rhC1INH) was expressed in the milk of transgenic rabbits (12 g/l) harboring genomic human C1INH sequences fused to 5' bovine αS(1) casein promoter sequences. Recombinant hC1INH was isolated from milk to a specific activity of 6.1 U/mg and a purity of 99%; by size-exclusion chromatography the 1% impurities consisted of multimers and N-terminal cleaved C1INH species. Mass spectrometric analysis of purified rhC1INH revealed a relative molecular mass (M(r)) of 67,200. Differences in M(r) on SDS PAGE and mass spectrometric analysis between rhC1INH and pd-hC1INH are explained by differential glycosylation (calculated carbohydrate contents of 21% and 28%, respectively), since protein sequencing analysis of rhC1INH revealed intact N- and C-termini. Host-related impurity analysis by ELISA revealed trace amounts of rabbit protein (approximately 10 ppm) in purified batches, but not endogenous rabbit C1INH. The kinetics of inhibition of the target proteases C1s, Factor XIIa, kallikrein and Factor XIa by rhC1INH and pd-hC1INH, indicated comparable inhibitory potency and specificity.

22988791,"According to the generally accepted theory, the atherosclerosis is a kind of disorder of metabolism of lipids which chemically are the ethers of fatty lipids with spirits. Hence, the atherosclerosis is fatty acids pathology. In conformity with the biologic classification, among fatty acids it is functionally valid to distinguish saturated fatty acids without double bonds; monoenic fatty acids with one double bond; unsaturated fatty acids with two or three double bonds and polyenic fatty acids with four of six double bonds in chain. The saturated and monenic fatty acids are the substrates for cells to groundwork energy, ATP The unsaturated fatty acids in vivo are needed to form membranes. The polyenic fatty acids are essential since they are precursors of cell synthesis of humoral regulators--eicosanoids (prostanoids and leukotrienes). To clarify the pathogenesis of the ""metabolic pandemics"" most prevalent in human population, the quantitative determination of individual fatty acids in blood plasma and erythrocytes using gas chromatography technique is needed. It is necessary to evaluate the content of medium chain fatty acids; palmitic and stearic saturated fatty acids; oleic monoenic fatty acid and its transforms--linoleic, linolenic and dihomo-gamma-linolenic unsaturated fatty acids; essential polyenic omega-6 arachidonic, omega-3 eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic fatty acids. The higher is in food the content of palmitic saturated fatty acid, palmitoleic and trans-vaccenic monoenic fatty acids, the more is in patient diet of beef meat and products of fat cow's milk. The higher is ratio of palmitic/oleic fatty acids the lower is the risk of formation of atheromatosis of arteries intima and development of ischemic heart disease and vice versa. The decrease of ratio of omega-3/omega-6 essential polyenic fatty acids is undesirable in prognostic sense. The metabolism of these acids differs and functional activity of omega-3 eicosanoid type 3 is higher In case of deficiency of omega-3 and omega-6 polyenic fatty acids in cells eicosanoids are synthesized from unsaturated dihomogamma-linolenic fatty acid and their influence turns out to be aphysiologic.

Flunixin, a nonsteroidal and anti-inflammatory drug, appears in dairy cattle tissue residues with a frequency similar to the occurrence of penicillin G. This creates concern that flunixin residues could be in milk and would go undetected under current milk screening programs. A single test  that combines mandatory β-lactam screening with voluntary flunixin screening is an economical approach for monitoring and controlling for potential flunixin or 5-hydroxyflunixin, the primary flunixin metabolite marker in milk. The objective of this study was to validate a β-lactam  and flunixin rapid lateral flow test (LFT) and compare the results obtained with a liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous determination of flunixin and 5-hydroxyflunixin in raw milk with a limit of detection of , 1 ppb, equivalent  to 1 ng/ml.

An increased incidence of aplasia cutis (a characteristic scalp defect) in consumers in Spain was linked to an increased consumption of antithyroid-contaminated meat. Therefore, to protect human health, the EU banned the use of antithyroid drugs in food animal production in 1981.

22901691,"Several studies demonstrated that fermented milks may provide a large number of bioactive peptides into the gastrointestinal tract. We previously showed that beta-casomorphin-7, an opioid-like peptide produced from bovine β-casein, strongly stimulates intestinal mucin production in ex vivo and in vitro models, suggesting the potential benefit of milk bioactive peptides on intestinal protection. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the total peptide pool (TPP) from a fermented milk (yoghurt) may act on human intestinal mucus-producing cells (HT29-MTX) to induce mucin expression. Our aim was then to identify the peptide(s) carrying the biological activity and to study its impact in vivo on factors involved in gut protection after oral administration to rat pups (once a day, 9 consecutive days). TPP stimulated MUC2 and MUC4 gene expression as well as mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Among the four peptide fractions that were separated by preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, only the C2 fraction was able to mimic the in vitro effect of TPP. Interestingly, the sequence [94-123] of β-casein, present only in C2 fraction, also regulated mucin production in HT29-MTX cells. Oral administration of this peptide to rat pups enhanced the number of goblet cells and Paneth cells along the small intestine. These effects were associated with a higher expression of intestinal mucins (Muc2 and Muc4) and of antibacterial factors (lysozyme, rdefa5). We conclude that the peptide β-CN(94-123) present in yoghurts may maintain or restore intestinal homeostasis and could play an important role in protection against damaging agents of the intestinal lumen.",The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,"['D000595', 'D000818', 'D002364', 'D002460', 'D005260', 'D005786', 'D020397', 'D006801', 'D007413', 'D007421', 'D008969', 'D055262', 'D055264', 'D009077', 'D019879', 'D010455', 'D051381', 'D017208', 'D015014']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Caseins', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goblet Cells', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa', 'Intestine, Small', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mucin-2', 'Mucin-4', 'Mucins', 'Paneth Cells', 'Peptides', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Yogurt']",A novel bioactive peptide from yoghurts modulates expression of the gel-forming MUC2 mucin as well as population of goblet cells and Paneth cells along the small intestine.,"[None, None, 'Q000494', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000166', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000378', 'Q000187', 'Q000302', None, None, None]","[None, None, 'pharmacology', 'drug effects', None, 'drug effects', 'drug effects', None, 'drug effects', 'cytology', None, 'genetics', 'genetics', 'metabolism', 'drug effects', 'isolation & purification', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22901691,2013,0

Due to developmental effects, PAE infants' exposure via human milk has been subjected to a number of analytical studies. These previous studies, however, revealed that normal laboratory blank values are in the range of or even higher than human milk levels due to the presence of PAE in laboratory environments. In order to provide more reliable data on PAE exposure via human milk, the aim of this study was to develop and validate a robust and sensitive analytical method. This should be capable of removing matrix components efficiently and guarantee limits of quantification in the low ppb range. The method development took into account liquid-liquid extraction and selective pressurised fluid extraction (sPFE) as well as chromatography-based clean-up steps. The final method consisted of a liquid-liquid extraction followed by an automated chromatographic clean-up by an sPFE device. After volume reduction the cleaned extracts were analysed by quadrupole GC/MS. Quantification was based on internal standards. An extensive quality assurance and method test programme demonstrated conservatively determined limits of detection and quantification from 0.3 to 10 ng g⁻¹ in human milk, with recoveries of internal standards from 50% to 101%. Thus, the method allowed the quality-assured detection of di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), di-allyl phthalate (DAP), benzylbutyl phthalate (BBP) and di-cyclohexyl phthalate (DcHP) in 30 human milk samples provided by 30 volunteers from southern Germany.

The lower limit of quantification was 2 ng/ml for each constituent. Calibration curves were linear over the range from 2 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml for all analytes (r(2)>0.99). The intra- and inter-day accuracies were 91-106.5% and 95.1-111.9%, respectively. The intra- and inter-day precision was within 10.5%. Additionally, recovery, stability, and matrix effects were fully validated as well. This method was successfully applied to human plasma samples from subjects treated with the milk thistle extract Legalon(®).","Journal of chromatography.

22676802,"Human milk proteins provide essential nutrition for growth and development, and support a number of vital developmental processes in the neonate. A complete understanding of the possible functions of human milk proteins has been limited by incomplete knowledge of the human milk proteome. In this report, we have analyzed the proteomes of whey from human transitional and mature milk using ion-exchange and SDS-PAGE based protein fractionation methods. With a larger-than-normal sample loading approach, we are able to largely extend human milk proteome to 976 proteins. Among them, 152 proteins are found to render significant regulatory changes between transitional milk and mature milk. We further found that immunoglobulins sIgA and IgM are more abundant in transitional milk, whereas IgG is more abundant in mature milk, suggesting a transformation in defense mechanism from newborns to young infants. Additionally, we report a more comprehensive view of a complement system and associated regulatory apparatus in human milk, demonstrating the presence and function of a system similar to that found in the circulation but prevailed by alternative pathway in complement activation. Proteins involved in various aspects of carbohydrate metabolism are also described, revealing either a transition in milk functionality to accommodate carbohydrate-rich secretions as lactation progresses, or a potentially novel way of looking at the metabolic state of the mammary tissue. Lately, a number of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins are found to be in higher abundance in transitional milk and may be relevant to the development of infants' gastrointestinal tract in early life. In contrast, the ECM protein fibronectin and several of the actin cytoskeleton proteins that it regulates are more abundant in mature milk, which may indicate the important functional role for milk in regulating reactive oxygen species.",Journal of proteome research,"['D000199', 'D050260', 'D002852', 'D003165', 'D016326', 'D005260', 'D005353', 'D006801', 'D007136', 'D007774', 'D053858', 'D008894', 'D008895', 'D060066', 'D020543', 'D017382', 'D015398', 'D053719']","['Actins', 'Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Complement System Proteins', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Female', 'Fibronectins', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Lactation', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Milk Proteins', 'Milk, Human', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Proteome', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Temporal changes in milk proteomes reveal developing milk functions.,"['Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000276', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378', None, None]","['metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'chemistry', 'immunology', None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22676802,2012,0
22579845,"Human milk contains high amounts of complex oligosaccharides, which can be utilized especially by Bifidobacterium species in the infant gut as a carbon and energy source. N-acetyl-D-glucosamine is a building block of these oligosaccharides, and molecular details on the release and utilization of this monosaccharide are not fully understood. In this work we have studied some of the enzymatic properties of three N-acetyl-β-D-hexosaminidases encoded by the genome of the intestinal isolate Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697 and the gene expression of the corresponding genes during bacterial growth on human milk oligosaccharides. These enzymes belong to the glycosyl hydrolase family 20, with several homologs in bifidobacteria. Their optimum pH was 5.0 and optimum temperature was 37 °C. The three enzymes were active on the GlcNAcβ1-3 linkage found in lacto-N-tetraose, the most abundant human milk oligosaccharide.

Bifidobacterium infantis N-acetyl-β-D-hexosaminidases were induced during early growth in vitro on human milk oligosaccharides, and also during growth on lacto-N-tetraose or lacto-N-neotetraose. The up-regulation of enzymes that convert this monosaccharide into UDP-N-acetylglucosamine by human milk oligosaccharides suggested that this activated sugar is used in peptidoglycan biosynthesis.

22578515,"Valuable pharmaceutical proteins produced from the mammary glands of transgenic livestock have potential use in the biomedical industry. In this study, recombinant human clotting factor IX (rhFIX) produced from transgenic sow milk for preclinical animal studies have been established. The transgenic sow milk was skimmed and treated with sodium phosphate buffer to remove abundant casein protein. Then, the γ-carboxylated rhFIX fraction was segregated through the Q Sepharose chromatography from uncarboxylated one. For safety issue, the process included virus inactivation by solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment. Subsequently, the S/D treated sample was loaded into the Heparin Sepharose column to recover the rhFIX fraction, which was then reapplied to the Heparin Sepharose column to enhance rhFIX purity and lower the ratio of activated form rhFIX (rhFIXa) easily. This was possible due to the higher affinity of the Heparin affinity sorbent for rhFIXa than for the rhFIX zymogen. Furthermore, an IgA removal column was used to eliminate porcine IgA in purified rhFIX. Finally, nanofiltration was performed for viral clearance. Consequently, a high-quality rhFIX product was produced (approximately 700 mg per batch). Other values for final rhFIX preparation were as follows: purity, >99%; average specific activity, 415.6±57.7 IU/mL and total milk impurity, <0.5 ng/mg. This is the first report that described the whole process and stable production of bioactive rhFIX from transgenic sow milk.

22575289,"Numerous efforts have been devoted to develop synthetic affinity ligands mimicking natural immunoglobulin-binding proteins, such as Proteins A and L, in order to overcome intrinsic drawbacks involving their high cost and acidic pH elution. However, few reports have focused on a Protein G mimic. This work describes the use of the solid phase multi-component Ugi reaction to generate a low cost, rationally designed, affinity ligand to mimic Protein G for the purification of mammalian immunoglobulins, including the heavy-chain only camelid IgGs, with effective elution at neutral pH. An aldehyde-functionalised Sepharose™ resin constituted one component (aldehyde) of the four-component Ugi reaction, whilst the other three components (a primary or secondary amine, a carboxylic acid and an isonitrile) were varied to generate a tri-substituted Ugi scaffold, with a wide range of functionality, suitable for mimicking peptides for immunoglobulin purification. Ligand A2C11I1 was designed to mimic Asn35 and Trp43 of Protein G (PDB: 1FCC) and in silico docking into the Fc domain showed a key binding interface closely resembling native Protein G. This candidate ligand demonstrated affinity towards IgGs derived from human, cow, goat, mouse, sheep, pig, rabbit and rat serum, chicken IgY and recombinant camelid Fc domain, out of which cow and sheep IgG demonstrated 100% binding under the conditions selected. Preparative chromatography of IgG from human serum under a standardised buffer regime eluted IgG of ∼65% purity, compared to ∼62% with Protein G. This adsorbent achieved highest elution of IgG at neutral pH (0.1M sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 30%, v/v, ethylene glycol), an advantage for purifying antibodies sensitive to extremes of pH. The ligand demonstrated a static binding capacity of 24.6 mg Ig G ml⁻¹ resin and a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 4.78 × 10⁻⁶ M. The solid phase Ugi scaffold provides a strategy to develop pseudo-biospecific ligands to purify immunoglobulins and other potentially high-value biotherapeutic proteins.","Journal of chromatography.

22494642,"Aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) that are formed by mixing a polymer (usually polyethylene glycol, PEG) and a salt (e.g. phosphate, sulphate or citrate) or two polymers, and water can be effectively used for the separation and purification of proteins. The partitioning between both phases is dependent on the surface properties of the proteins and on the composition of the two phase system as has been recently reviewed by Asenjo and Andrews [1]. This paper analyses and reviews some elements that are important for implementation of these processes which are related to phase separation and continuous processing of ATPS. Phase separation for ATPS formed by PEG and salts has been studied and has been found to depend on which of the phases is continuous. Profiles of dispersion heights can be represented as a fraction of the initial height and are independent of the dimensions of the separator. This is important for the design of large scale aqueous two-phase separations. The kinetics of phase separation has been investigated as a function of the physical properties of the system. The settling rate is a crucial parameter for equipment design and it has been studied as a function of viscosity and density of the phases as well as the interfacial tension between them. Correlations that describe the rate of phase separation have been developed. Working in a continuous bottom-phase region is advantageous to ensure fast separation. A mathematical model to describe the continuous, study state operation of these systems has been investigated. Two simulations to show the effect of phase ratio on purification have been carried out which clearly show the effectivity of using such models. The practical application of ATPS has been demonstrated in many cases including a number of industrial applications with excellent levels of purity and yield. Examples include the purification of α-amylase and the large scale ""in situ"" purification of IGF-1 carried out by Genentech. The production scale purification of chymosin from recombinant Aspergillus supernatant is the most successful industrial application of this technology. Other applications include the separation and purification of human α-antitrypsin from transgenic sheep milk, the purification of monoclonal antibodies, tPA from CHO supernatant and recombinant VLPs (virus like particles) from yeast cells.",Journal of chromatography.

22439776,"The isolation of whey proteins from human and bovine milks followed by profiling of their entire N-glycan repertoire is described. Whey proteins resulting from centrifugation and ethanol precipitation of milk were treated with PNGase F to release protein-bound N-glycans. Once released, N-glycans were analyzed via nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry following chromatographic separation on a porous graphitized carbon chip. In all, 38 N-glycan compositions were observed in the human milk sample while the bovine milk sample revealed 51 N-glycan compositions. These numbers translate to over a hundred compounds when isomers are considered and point to the complexity of the mixture. High mannose, neutral, and sialylated complex/hybrid glycans were observed in both milk sources. Although NeuAc sialylation was observed in both milk samples, the NeuGc residue was only observed in bovine milk and marks a major difference between human and bovine milks. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first MS based confirmation of NeuGc in milk protein bound glycans as well as the first comprehensive N-glycan profile of bovine milk proteins. Tandem MS was necessary for resolving complications presented by the fact that (NeuGc:Fuc) corresponds to the exact mass of (NeuAc:Hex). Comparison of the relative distribution of the different glycan types in both milk sources was possible via their abundances. While the human milk analysis revealed a 6% high mannose, 57% sialylation, and 75% fucosylation distribution, a 10% high mannose, 68% sialylation, and 31% fucosylation distribution was observed in the bovine milk analysis. Comparison with the free milk oligosaccharides yielded low sialylation and high fucosylation in human, while high sialylation and low fucosylation are found in bovine.

22436225,"On the basis of the isomer-specific effects of trans fatty acids (FA) on human health, and the detrimental effect of t10,c12-conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on cows' milk fat production, there is a need to identify factors that affect the shift from trans-11 to trans-10 pathway during ruminal biohydrogenation of FA. This experiment was conducted in vitro and aimed at separating the effects of the diet of the donor cows from those of the fermentative substrate, which is necessary to prevent this shift. A total of four dry Holstein dairy cows were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design. They received 12 kg of dry matter per day of four diets based on maize silage during four successive periods: the control diet (22% starch, <3% fat); the high-starch diet, supplemented with wheat plus barley (35% starch, <3% crude fat); the sunflower oil diet, supplemented with 5% of sunflower oil (20% starch, 7.6% crude fat); and the high-starch plus oil diet (33% starch, 7.3% crude fat). Ruminal fluid of each donor cow was incubated for 5 h with four substrates having similar chemical composition to the diets, replacing sunflower oil by pure linoleic acid (LA). The efficiency of isomerisation of LA to CLA was the highest when rumen fluids from cows receiving dietary oil were incubated with added LA. The shift from trans-11 to trans-10 isomers was induced in vitro by high-starch diets and the addition of LA. Oil supplementation to the diet of the donor cows increased this shift. Conversely, the trans-10 isomer balance was always low when no LA was added to incubation cultures. These results showed that a large accumulation of trans-10 FA was only observed with an adapted microflora, as well as an addition of non-esterified LA to the incubation substrate.",Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,"['D000818', 'D018407', 'D002417', 'D002849', 'D004032', 'D019587', 'D005260', 'D006865', 'D019787', 'D010938', 'D012417', 'D013213', 'D000074242', 'D044242']","['Animals', 'Bacterial Physiological Phenomena', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Diet', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Female', 'Hydrogenation', 'Linoleic Acid', 'Plant Oils', 'Rumen', 'Starch', 'Sunflower Oil', 'Trans Fatty Acids']",In vitro study of dietary factors affecting the biohydrogenation shift from trans-11 to trans-10 fatty acids in the rumen of dairy cows.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000662', None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000008', 'Q000378', 'Q000008', None, 'Q000378']","[None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'veterinary', None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'administration & dosage', 'metabolism', 'administration & dosage', None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22436225,2012,0
22425755,"The doramectin (DOR), which belongs to the avermectins group (AVM), has a high antiparasitic activity and so it has been widely used in food-producing animals. The DOR shows low fluorescence quantum efficiency and as a consequence, chemical derivatization reactions are necessary to produce derivatives with improved luminescent properties before its determination by fluorimetry. As the presence of this compound in food represents a risk to human health, an easy, clean and low cost derivatization reaction, which is alternative to those usually employed and that enables its spectrofluorimetric determination in milk samples, was developed. Ethanolic solutions of DOR, containing sodium hydroxide at a final concentration of 0.25 mol L(-1), after 60 min of heating at 50 °C, produced fluorescent signals 1000 times higher than the original ethanolic solution. Using these optimized conditions, a linear response range that extended from 50.00 to 1000 μg L(-1), with a value of (R(2)) equal to 0.9970, was obtained. Average recovery of DOR was 92.5±1.5% (n=3) in bovine milk fortified samples submitted to a liquid-liquid extraction at low temperature and pre concentration process, indicating the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

We analyzed primary constituents' contents in chromatorgraphic material and fractions. The results showed that the lipid in milk can clog the column or adhere to the resin through hydrophobic interaction, leading to an increase in column pressure. Some casein molecules were found to adsorb onto the resin through electrostatic interaction, therefore the adsorption capacity was decreased. There was no direct interaction between lactose and the resin in the chromatorgraphic process. Increased continuous chromatographic cycles and prolonged time interval between protein purification and column regeneration could enhance the undesirable interaction between the contaminants and resin, thus lowering the regeneration efficiency.

22365192,"Although several studies have been devoted to the colloidal and soluble protein fractions of mare milk (caseins and whey proteins), to date little is known about the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) protein fraction from mare milk. The objective of this study was thus to describe MFGM proteins from Equidae milk and to compare those proteins to already described MFGM proteins from cow and goat milk. Major MFGM proteins (namely, xanthine oxidase, butyrophilin, lactadherin, and adipophilin) already described in cow or goat milk were identified in mare milk using mass spectrometry. However, species-specific peculiarities were observed for 2 MFGM proteins: butyrophilin and lactadherin. A highly glycosylated 70-kDa protein was characterized for equine butyrophilin, whereas proteins of 64 and 67 kDa were characterized for cow and goat butyrophilin, respectively. Prominent differences across species were highlighted for lactadherin. Indeed, whereas 1 or 2 polypeptide chains were identified, respectively, by peptide mass fingerprinting matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight analysis for caprine and bovine lactadherin, 4 isoforms (60, 57, 48, and 45 kDa) for lactadherin from mare milk were identified by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE. Polymerase chain reaction experiments on lactadherin transcripts isolated from milk fat globules revealed the existence of 2 distinct lactadherin transcripts in the horse mammary gland. Cloning and sequencing of both transcripts encoding lactadherin showed an alternative use of a cryptic splice site located at the end of intron 5 of the equine lactadherin-encoding gene. This event results in the occurrence of an additional alanine (A) residue in the protein that disrupts a putative atypical N-glycosylation site (VNGC/VNAGC) described in human lactadherin. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry analyses confirmed the existence of both lactadherin variants in mare MFGM.

Therefore, 226 samples were collected from farms and local markets during November 2008 until April 2010. Samples consisted of 112 raw cow milk, 56 blood from lactating cows and 58 feed destined for dairy cows. Plasma and feed were analysed for aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁). Milk samples were analysed for aflatoxin M₁ (AFM₁). All samples were treated using a simultaneous methanolic-aqueous extraction, followed by immunoaffinity column clean-ups and were investigated by competitive enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Recoveries were 80%-95% and 81%-92% for AFB₁ and AFM₁, respectively, while the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.01 µg/kg or µg/l for both mycotoxins. Results revealed the presence of AFB₁ in 84.4% of the feed samples (mean 18.7 ± 1.4 µg/kg), and 39.2% of the plasma-examined samples (median 7.1 ± 1.0 µg/l) were found to be contaminated at levels higher than the Tunisian and the European Union (EU) limit for dairy animals, which are 20 and 5 µg/kg in animal feed, respectively.

Bovine milk contains considerable quantities of hormones and it is of particular concern. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, based on hydroxylamine derivatisation, has been developed and validated for the quantification of six sex hormones in milk [pregnenolone (P₅), progesterone (P₄), estrone (E₁), testosterone (T), androstenedione (A) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)]. This method has been applied to real raw milk samples and the existence of differences between milk from pregnant and non-pregnant cows has been statistically confirmed.

There are limited data on levels of PCBs and OCPs in humans but no previous reports from Turkey on chemically determined levels PAHs in human milk. The aim of this study was to report the levels and accumulation profiles of OCPs, PCBs and PAHs in 47 breast milk samples obtained from a Mediterranean city, Mersin. High resolution analyses were performed by a gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (4.4'-DDE) was the dominant pollutant. Beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (ß-HCH), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (4.4'-DDT), dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene, oxy-chlordane, cis-heptachlorepoxide were the other main OCPs detected. Mean levels of ΣPCB congeners and WHO(PCB)-TEQ were 9.94 and 0.001 ng/g lipid, respectively. PCB 153 showed the highest concentration (3.37 ng/g lipid), followed by PCB 138 and 180. For the dioxin-like PCBs, PCB 118 was the dominant (0.97 ng/g lipid). Naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene and fluoranthene were the major PAHs among the 16 PAHs detected. The estimated daily intakes of DDTs, PCBs, HCHs and HCB were not exceeded the tolerable daily intake (TDI) proposed by the Health Canada Guideline.

Currently, it is widely recognized that milk benefits go beyond mere nutrition and serve as a source of a number of functional components to the newborn, particularly host defense effectors. However, the human milk proteome description is still incomplete, primarily because the detection of low-abundance proteins remains challenging. To overcome the limitations of the classical electrophoresis-based approach, previously separated milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) and whey protein fractions were analyzed by nanoflow-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/Fourier Transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry (MS). This shotgun strategy showed an as yet unmatched potential to profile low-abundance proteins in human milk. Proteins associated with 301 different gene products were identified, some of which could be clustered into subsets of protein isoforms, thus providing one of the largest protein inventories of human milk. The identified proteins, which were derived from multiple metabolic pathways, are involved in different physiological functions, such as membrane trafficking, cell signaling, fat metabolism and transport, metabolite delivery, protein synthesis/proteolysis or folding, and immunity-related actions. Nevertheless, it appears clear from this study that the overall picture of the human milk proteome is still incomplete, although several protein signatures of milk evolution are emerging.",Journal of chromatography.

22247688,"Dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) are hazardous toxic, ubiquitous and persistent chemical compounds, which can enter the food chain and accumulate up to higher trophic levels. Their determination requires sophisticated methods, expensive facilities and instruments, well-trained personnel and expensive chemical reagents. Ideally, real-time monitoring using rapid detection methods should be applied to detect possible contamination along the food chain in order to prevent human exposure. Sensor technology may be promising in this respect. This review gives the state of the art for detecting possible contamination with dioxins and DL-PCBs along the food chain of animal-source foods. The main detection methods applied (i.e., high resolution gas-chromatography combined with high resolution mass-spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) and the chemical activated luciferase gene expression method (CALUX bioassay)), each have their limitations. Biosensors for detecting dioxins and related compounds, although still under development, show potential to overcome these limitations. Immunosensors and biomimetic-based biosensors potentially offer increased selectivity and sensitivity for dioxin and DL-PCB detection, while whole cell-based biosensors present interpretable biological results. The main shortcoming of current biosensors, however, is their detection level: this may be insufficient as limits for dioxins and DL-PCBs for food and feedstuffs are in pg per gram level. In addition, these contaminants are normally present in fat, a difficult matrix for biosensor detection. Therefore, simple and efficient extraction and clean-up procedures are required which may enable biosensors to detect dioxins and DL-PCBs contamination along the food chain.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","['D000818', 'D015374', 'D004147', 'D004531', 'D020387', 'D008460', 'D008892', 'D011078']","['Animals', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Dioxins', 'Eggs', 'Food Chain', 'Meat', 'Milk', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls']","The need and potential of biosensors to detect dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls along the milk, eggs and meat food chain.","[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22247688,2012,0

In vitro digestion systems have proven to be powerful tools for understanding and monitoring the complex transformation processes that take place during digestion. Moreover, the investigation of the physiological effects of certain nutrients demands an in vitro digestive process that is close to human physiology. In this study, human digestion was simulated with a 3-step in vitro process that was validated in depth by choosing pasteurized milk as an example of a complex food matrix. The evolution and decomposition of the macronutrients was followed over the entire digestive process to the level of intestinal enterocyte action, using protein and peptide analysis by SDS-PAGE, reversed-phase HPLC, size exclusion HPLC, and liquid chromatography-MS. The mean peptide size after in vitro digestion of pasteurized milk was 5-6 amino acids (AA). Interestingly, mostly essential AA (93.6%) were released during in vitro milk digestion, a significantly different relative distribution compared to the total essential AA concentration of bovine milk (44.5%). All TG were degraded to FFA and monoacylglycerols.

FBP contains multiple N-glycosilation sites, is selectively expressed in tissues and body fluids, and mediates targeted therapies in cancer and inflammatory diseases. Much remains to be understood about the structure, composition, and the tissue specificities of N-glycans bound to FBP. Here, we performed structural characterization of N-linked glycans originating from bovine and human milk FBPs. The N-linked glycans were enzymatically released from FBPs, purified, and permethylated. Native and permethylated glycans were further analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS), while tandem MS (MS/MS) was used for their structural characterization. The assignment of putative glycan structures from MS and MS/MS data was achieved using Functional Glycomics glycan database and SimGlycan software, respectively. It was found that FBP from human milk contains putative structures that have composition consistent with high-mannose (Hex(5-6)HexNAc(2)) as well as hybrid and complex N-linked glycans (NeuAc(0-1)Fuc(0-3)Hex(3-6)HexNAc(3-5)).

22065561,"Mold metabolites that can elicit deleterious effects on other organisms are classified as mycotoxins. Human exposure to mycotoxins occurs mostly through the intake of contaminated agricultural products or residues due to carry over or metabolite products in foods of animal origin such as milk and eggs, but can also occur by dermal contact and inhalation. Mycotoxins contained in moldy foods, but also in damp interiors, can cause diseases in humans and animals. Nephropathy, various types of cancer, alimentary toxic aleukia, hepatic diseases, various hemorrhagic syndromes, and immune and neurological disorders are the most common diseases that can be related to mycotoxicosis. The absence or presence of mold infestation and its propagation are seldom correlated with mycotoxin presence. Mycotoxins must be determined directly, and suitable analytical methods are necessary. Hundreds of mycotoxins have been recognized, but only for a few of them, and in a restricted number of utilities, a maximum acceptable level has been regulated by law. However, mycotoxins seldom develop alone; more often various types and/or classes form in the same substrate. The co-occurrence might render the individual mycotoxin tolerance dose irrelevant, and therefore the mere presence of multiple mycotoxins should be considered a risk factor. The advantage of chromatography/mass spectrometry (MS) is that many compounds can be determined and confirmed in one analysis. This review illustrates the state-of-the-art of mycotoxin MS-based analytical methods for multiclass, multianalyte determination in all the matrices in which they appear. A chapter is devoted to the history of the long-standing coexistence and interaction among humans, domestic animals and mycotoxicosis, and the history of the discovery of mycotoxins. Quality assurance, although this topic relates to analytical chemistry in general, has been also examined for mycotoxin analysis as a preliminary to the systematic literature excursus. Sample handling is a crucial step to devise a multiclass analytical method; so when possible, it has been treated separately for a better comparison before tackling the instrumental part of the whole analytical method. This structure has resulted sometimes in unavoidable redundancies, because it was also important to underline the interconnection. Most reviews do not deal with all the possible mycotoxin sources, including the environmental ones. The focus of this review is the analytical methods based on MS for multimycotoxin class determination. Because the final purpose to devise multimycotoxin analysis should be the assessment of the danger to health of exposition to multitoxicants of natural origin (and possibly also the interaction with anthropogenic contaminants), therefore also the analytical methods for environmental relevant mycotoxins have been thoroughly reviewed. Finally, because the best way to shed light on actual risk assessment could be the individuation of exposure biomarkers, the review covers also the scarce literature on biological fluids.",Mass spectrometry reviews,"['D000818', 'D002853', 'D004781', 'D005516', 'D049690', 'D006801', 'D013058', 'D015651', 'D009183', 'D012988', 'D014871']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Food Microbiology', 'History, Ancient', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mycotoxicosis', 'Mycotoxins', 'Soil Microbiology', 'Water Microbiology']","Multiclass mycotoxin analysis in food, environmental and biological matrices with chromatography/mass spectrometry.","[None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000266', 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, 'methods', 'analysis', 'methods', None, None, 'methods', 'history', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22065561,2012,0

No significant changes in bacterial species composition or in the proportional representation of genes encoding known enzymes were observed in the feces of humans consuming the FMP. Only minimal changes in microbiota configuration were noted in mice after single or repeated gavage with the FMP consortium. However, RNA-Seq analysis of fecal samples and follow-up mass spectrometry of urinary metabolites disclosed that introducing the FMP strains into mice results in significant changes in expression of microbiome-encoded enzymes involved in numerous metabolic pathways, most prominently those related to carbohydrate metabolism. B. animalis subsp. lactis, the dominant persistent member of the FMP consortium in gnotobiotic mice, up-regulates a locus in vivo that is involved in the catabolism of xylooligosaccharides, a class of glycans widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, and other foods, underscoring the importance of these sugars to this bacterial species. The human fecal metatranscriptome exhibited significant changes, confined to the period of FMP consumption, that mirror changes in gnotobiotic mice, including those related to plant polysaccharide metabolism. These experiments illustrate a translational research pipeline for characterizing the effects of FMPs on the human gut microbiome.",Science translational medicine,"['D000818', 'D001644', 'D043302', 'D005260', 'D041981', 'D005856', 'D006801', 'D007778', 'D008297', 'D054892', 'D051379', 'D008810', 'D008969', 'D019936', 'D014430']","['Animals', 'Bifidobacterium', 'Cultured Milk Products', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Tract', 'Germ-Free Life', 'Humans', 'Lactobacillus', 'Male', 'Metagenome', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Probiotics', 'Twins, Monozygotic']",The impact of a consortium of fermented milk strains on the gut microbiome of gnotobiotic mice and monozygotic twins.,"[None, None, 'Q000382', None, 'Q000382', None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', None, None, None, 'Q000008', None]","[None, None, 'microbiology', None, 'microbiology', None, None, None, None, 'genetics', None, None, None, 'administration & dosage', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22030749,2012,0
21979575,"The conjugation of polypeptides from a designed set to the small molecule ligand 3,5-bis[[bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amino]methyl]benzoic acid, which in the presence of Zn(2+) ions binds inorganic phosphate, has been shown to provide a polypeptide conjugate that binds α-casein, a multiply phosphorylated protein, with a dissociation constant K(D) of 17 nM. The measured affinity is more than three orders of magnitude higher than that of the small molecule ligand for phosphate and the binding of 500 nM of α-casein was not inhibited by 10 mM phosphate buffer, providing a 2000-fold excess of phosphate ion over protein. The selectivity for phosphoproteins was demonstrated by extraction of α-casein from solutions of various complexity, including milk and human serum spiked with α-casein. In addition to α-casein, β-casein was also recognized but not ovoalbumin. Conjugation of a polypeptide to the zinc chelating ligand was therefore shown to give rise to dramatically increased affinity and also increased selectivity. A set of polypeptide conjugates is expected to be able to capture a large number of phosphorylated proteins, perhaps all, and in combination with electrophoresis or mass spectrometry become a powerful tool for the monitoring of phosphorylation levels. The presented binder can easily be attached to various types of surfaces; here demonstrated for the case of polystyrene particles. The example of phosphoproteins was selected since posttranslational phosphorylation is of fundamental importance in cell biology due to its role in signaling and therefore of great interest in drug development.

Independent of the initial presence of acidic or neutral fecal HMOs, a gradual change to blood-group specific oligosaccharides was observed. Their presence pointed to a gastrointestinal degradation of the feeding-related HMOs, followed by conjugation with blood group specific antigenic determinants present in the gastrointestinal mucus layer.

Spot samples of urinary iodine (UI) are used as an epidemiologic index of adult iodine nutrition. Individual infant iodine nutrition is of vital importance, but infant urine is difficult to collect, much less a 24 h sample. Monitoring the intake provides a pragmatic solution for determining infant iodine nutrition. Because of the high solids content of milk and the possible existence of iodine in an organically bound form, sample digestion is obligatory. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, uses wet ashing by HClO(4); special precautions and fume hoods are required. We present a method of Fenton digestion of human and bovine milk samples and infant formula. No specialized equipment or hazardous reagents are used; measurement is made by isotope dilution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In Fenton digestion, Fe(II) and H(2)O(2) oxidizes the sample. In an interlaboratory study, excellent agreement (r(2) = 0.9934) was observed with results obtained by HClO(4) digestion and Sandel-Kolthoff kinetic colorimetry. Average recoveries of iodide, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine ranged between 100% and 101%. Following digestion, iodine was found to exist entirely as iodide.

21907019,"Residues of steroid hormones have become a cause for concern because they can affect the biological activity of non-target organisms. Steroid hormones are a potential risk for wildlife and humans through the consumption of contaminated food or water. Their determination requires extraction and clean-up steps, prior to detection, to reach low concentration levels. In recent years, a great effort has been made to develop new analytical methodologies, such as microextraction techniques, that reduce environmental pollution. Researchers have modified old methods to incorporate procedures that use less-hazardous chemicals or that use smaller amounts of them. They are able to do direct analysis using miniaturised equipment and reduced amounts of solvents and wastes. These accomplishments are the main objectives of green analytical chemistry. In this overview, we focus on microextraction techniques for the determination of steroid hormones in biological (e.g., human urine, human serum, fish, shrimp and prawn tissue and milk) and environmental (e.g., wastewaters, surface waters, tap waters, river waters, sewage sludges, marine sediments and river sediments) samples. We comment on the most recent applications in sorptive-microextraction modes, such as solid phase microextraction (SPME) with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), in-tube solid-phase microextraction (IT-SPME), stir-bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) and microextraction in packed sorbent (MEPS).

In addition, the frequency of fish consumption was estimated, because fish is generally the main pathway for human exposure to MeHg. Hair samples were collected from 574 women participating in this study, while cord blood and breast milk samples were collected from 446 and 284 women, respectively. As expected, the levels of THg in hair (median (Med)=297 ng/g, 10th percentile (P10)=73 ng/g, 90th percentile (P90)=781 ng/g), cord blood (Med=1.5 ng/g, P10=0.5 ng/g, P90=4.2 ng/g) and breast milk (Med=0.2 ng/g, P10=0.06 ng/g, P90=0.6 ng/g) were low, due to low consumption of fish (X=25 g/day). A significant linear correlation was found between levels of lnTHg in hair and lnTHg in cord blood (r=0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84-0.89), between levels of lnTHg in hair and lnMeHg in cord blood (r=0.94, 95% CI: 0.90-0.96) and between lnTHg levels in cord blood and lnTHg levels in breast milk (r=0.36, 95% CI: 0.25-0.47).

This could be due to the approximate information on fish consumption obtained from the questionnaires, the high variability of MeHg concentrations in fish and a relatively high proportion of inorganic mercury in the biomarkers which originates from sources other than fish.

21824815,"An aspartic protease (Cap1) was purified from basidiomycetous yeast Cryptococcus sp. S-2 (FERM ABP-10961) using HiTrap DEAE FF column and HiTrap Q HP column chromatography with azocasein as a substrate. Cap1 has a molecular mass of 34 kDa on SDS-PAGE. It was stable up to 50°C with maximum activity at 30°C. Maximum proteolytic activity was observed at pH 5.0. Cap1 was stable in the pH range 3.0-7.0. Its enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by pepstatin A, an inhibitor of aspartic proteases, indicating that Cap1 is an aspartic protease. Cap1 hydrolyzed protein substrates, including BSA, hemoglobin, α-casein, β-casein, and κ-casein. It showed activity on synthetic substrates, such as MOCAc-Gly-Lys-Pro-Ile-Leu-Phe-Phe-Arg-Leu-Lys(Dnp)-D-Arg-NH₂ and MOCAc-Ala-Pro-Ala-Lys-Phe-Phe-Arg-Leu-Lys(Dnp)-NH₂. Hydrolysis of the oxidized insulin B chain followed by amino acid sequencing analysis of the cleavage products revealed that 9 of its 30 peptide bonds were hydrolyzed by Cap1. This result was similar to that observed with pig pepsin A and human pepsin A. Cap1 also exhibited milk-clotting activity. We cloned the cDNA of CAP1 gene, which contained a 1254 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 417 amino acid residues. Homology search in the NCBI database revealed that the amino acid sequence of Cap1 showed less than 39% identity to other known proteins.

Specific growth rates were compared when Saccharomyces cerevisiae was grown in soy skim and peptone-yeast extract media supplemented with glucose. Such soy skim was proved to be a good nitrogen source for yeast growth. Next, fermentation of dry-ground corn to ethanol using soy skim as the media was simulated on 1.5-L scale. Replacing water with soy skim increased the initial ethanol production rates by 4-32% while final ethanol yield was about 39 g/100 g dry corn, similar to the result when water was used.

21773735,"This article covers challenges and trends in the determination of some major food chemical contaminants and allergens, which-among others-are being monitored by Health Canada's Food Directorate and for which background levels in food and human exposure are being analyzed and calculated. Eleven different contaminants/contaminant groups and allergens have been selected for detailed discussion in this paper. They occur in foods as a result of: use as a food additive or ingredient; processing-induced reactions; food packaging migration; deliberate adulteration; and/or presence as a chemical contaminant or natural toxin in the environment. Examples include acrylamide as a food-processing-induced contaminant, bisphenol A as a food packaging-derived chemical, melamine and related compounds as food adulterants and persistent organic pollutants, and perchlorate as an environmental contaminant. Ochratoxin A, fumonisins, and paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins are examples of naturally occurring toxins whereas sulfites, peanuts, and milk exemplify common allergenic food additives/ingredients. To deal with the increasing number of sample matrices and analytes of interest, two analytical approaches have become increasingly prevalent. The first has been the development of rapid screening methods for a variety of analytes based on immunochemical techniques, utilizing ELISA or surface plasmon resonance technology. The second is the development of highly sophisticated multi-analyte methods based on liquid chromatography coupled with multiple-stage mass spectrometry for identification and simultaneous quantification of a wide range of contaminants, often with much less requirement for tedious cleanup procedures. Whereas rapid screening methods enable testing of large numbers of samples, the multi analyte mass spectrometric methods enable full quantification with confirmation of the analytes of interest. Both approaches are useful when gathering surveillance data to determine occurrence and background levels of both recognized and newly identified contaminants in foods in order to estimate human daily intake for health risk assessment.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D000485', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D059022', 'D006801']","['Allergens', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Safety', 'Humans']",Challenges and trends in the determination of selected chemical contaminants and allergens in food.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None]","['analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21773735,2012,0

To evaluate the effect of the food matrix composition on the survival of L. amylovorus DSM 16698 in TIM-1, the microorganism was inoculated alone or with prebiotic galactooligosaccharides (GOS), partially skimmed milk (PSM) and/or commercial probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12 (Bb-12). Samples were collected from TIM-1 for six hours, at one-hour intervals and L. amylovorus populations were enumerated on MRS agar plates with confirmation of identity of selected isolates by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting. The cumulative survival for L. amylovorus alone (control) was 30% at the end of the experiment (t=6h). Co-administration of L. amylovorus with GOS, PSM and/or Bb-12 increased its survival in comparison with the control significantly from the 4th hour after ingestion onwards (P<0.05). Furthermore, by the use of High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography, both L. amylovorus and Bb-12 were observed to promptly degrade GOS compounds in samples collected from TIM-1, as assessed at t=2h.

Propylthiouracil (PTU) was extracted from 7.5 mL of the basic solution (the source phase) with pH 12 into an organic phase (n-octanol containing 6% (w/v) of Aliquat 336 as the carrier) impregnated in the pores of a hollow fiber, and finally was back extracted into 24 μL of the acidic solution located inside the lumen of the hollow fiber (the receiving phase). The extraction was performed through the gradient of counter ion from the source to the receiving phase. The effects of different variables on the extraction efficiency were studied simultaneously using an experimental design. A half-fractional factorial design was employed for screening to determine the variables significantly affecting the extraction efficiency. Then, the factors with significant effect were optimized using a central composite design (CCD) and the response surface equations were developed. The optimal experimental conditions obtained from this statistical evaluation included: source phase, pH 12; temperature, 25°C; extraction time, 40 min; counter ion concentration, 2 mol L(-1) of NaClO(4); organic solvent 6% of Aliquat in octanol and without salt addition in the source phase.

The Holder method modified bile salt-stimulated lipase, lactoferrin and components of the immune system. The HTST method preserved the integrity of bile salt-stimulated lipase, lactoferrin and, to some extent, of IgAs. Holder pasteurization decreased the amount of bile salt-stimulated lipase and inactivated the remaining molecules, while the HTST method did not alter its activity.

The list of target analytes comprises four classes of PFASs, both ionic and non-ionic: 11 perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), 4 perfluorosulphonic acids (PFSAs), 5 perfluorosulphonamides (FOSAs) and 3 perfluorophosphonic acids (PFPAs). Fast sample preparation procedure is based on an extraction of target analytes with acetonitrile (MeCN) and their transfer (supported by inorganic salts and acidification) into the organic phase. Removing of matrix co-extracts by a simple dispersive solid phase extraction (SPE) employing ENVI-Carb and C18 sorbents is followed by an efficient sample pre-concentration performed by acetonitrile evaporation and subsequent dilution of residue in a small volume of methanol (matrix equivalent in the final extracts was 16 and 8 g mL(-1), for milk and fish respectively). Using modern instrumentation consisting of ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) hyphenated with a tandem mass spectrometer (MS/MS), limits of quantification (LOQs) as low as 0.001-0.006 μg kg(-1) for milk and 0.002-0.013 μg kg(-1) for fish can be achieved.

There was a reverse tendency to aggregation during concentration of lectin solutions. Similar processes can take place in nature because of considerable individual variations of the lectin activity during growth of mushroom fruit bodies.

The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92-100) and β-casein f(191-205) matched.

Sphingosine (d18:1) was the predominant sphingoid base, with 83.6 ± 3.5% in human breast milk, followed by 4,8-sphingadienine (d18:2) (7.2 ± 1.9%) and 4-hydroxysphinganine (t18:0) (5.7 ± 0.7%). The main SM species contained sphingosine and palmitic acid (14.9 ± 2.2%), stearic acid (12.7 ± 1.5%), docosanoic acid (16.2 ± 3.6%), and tetracosenoic acid (15.0 ± 3.1%). Interestingly, the fatty acid composition of SM species in this study differs from the total fatty acids in human breast milk, and the fatty acids are not consistently distributed among the different sphingoid bases.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002851', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D008895', 'D015394', 'D013109', 'D053719', 'D055815']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Milk, Human', 'Molecular Structure', 'Sphingomyelins', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Young Adult']",Structural profiling and quantification of sphingomyelin in human breast milk by HPLC-MS/MS.,"['Q000379', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', None]","['methods', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'methods', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21534545,2011,0
21533801,"The strategy to concentrate phosphopeptides has become a critical issue for mapping protein phosphorylation sites, which are well known as posttranslational modifications in proteomics. In this study, we propose a simple and highly sensitive method for phosphopeptide enrichment on NiO nanoparticles (NPs) from a trypsin predigested phosphoprotein complex solution in a microwave oven. Furthermore, this technique was combined with centrifugation on-particle ionization/enrichment of phosphopeptides and phosphopeptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Weak magnetism of these NPs and a positive surface charge effect at low pH accomplished rapid and selective phosphopeptide enrichment within 30s. Trypsin-digested products of phosphoproteins such as α-casein and β-casein, human blood serum, nonfat milk, and egg white were also investigated to explore their phosphopeptide enrichment from complex samples by this approach. The results demonstrate that NiO NPs exhibit good affinity to trace the phosphopeptides even in the presence of 30 times higher molar concentration of complex solution of non-phosphopeptide proteolytic predigested bovine serum albumin. The detection limits of NiO NPs for α-casein and β-casein were 2.0 × 10(-9) M, with good signal-to-noise ratio in the mass spectrum. NiO NPs were found to be effective and selective for enrichment of singly and multiply phosphorylated peptides at a trace level in complex samples in a microwave oven. The cost of preparing NiO NPs is low, the NiO NPs are thermally stable, and therefore, they hold great promise for use in phosphopeptide enrichment.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D002498', 'D008722', 'D008872', 'D053758', 'D009532', 'D010748', 'D019032']","['Centrifugation', 'Methods', 'Microwaves', 'Nanoparticles', 'Nickel', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",Highly selective and sensitive enrichment of phosphopeptides via NiO nanoparticles using a microwave-assisted centrifugation on-particle ionization/enrichment approach in MALDI-MS.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379']","[None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21533801,2011,0

Silybin is almost 1:1 mixture of two diastereomers A and B. The individual UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) contributing to the metabolism of silybin diastereomers have not been identified yet. In this study, the contribution of UGTs to silybin metabolism was examined. The potential silybin metabolites were formed in vitro by incubating silybin (i) with the human liver microsomal fraction, (ii) with human hepatocytes and finally (iii) with 12 recombinant UGTs (UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A7, 1A8, 1A9, 1A10, 2B4, 2B7, 2B15 and 2B17). High-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) techniques with UV detection and additionally MS detection were used for metabolite identification. Hepatocytes and microsomes formed silybin A-7-O-β-D-glucuronides, B-7-O-β-D-glucuronides, A-20-O-β-D-glucuronides and B-20-O-β-D-glucuronides.

21505870,"One of characteristics of diabetes mellitus (DM) is endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction and apoptosis which contributes to the development of vasculopathy. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) continuously produced in the setting of DM play an important role in causing EC dysfunction and apoptosis. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely elusive. Lactadherin, a secreted glycoprotein of milk-fat globule, is expressed by multiple cell types of arterial wall including ECs. Our previous proteomic studies showed that the expression of lactadherin was significantly increased in the aorta of diabetic rats as compared with control rats and treatment with grape seed procyanidin extracts significantly inhibited the lactadherin expression in diabetic rats. We hypothesized that lactadherin plays a critical role in AGEs-induced EC apoptosis; grape seed procyanidin B2 (GSPB2) and resveratrol protect against AGEs-induced EC apoptosis through lactadherin regulation. Our results showed that AGEs upregulated lactadherin expression and lactadherin RNA interference significantly attenuated AGEs-induced EC apoptosis. Overexpression of lactadherin increased EC apoptosis with up-regulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cytochrome c release, caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation suggesting the involvement of mitochondria apoptosis pathway. Mechanistically, overexpression of lactadherin reduced the phosphorylation of GSK3beta at baseline. Our study also revealed nine proteins interacting with lactadherin in HUVEC and study of these candidate proteins could unveil further underlying molecular mechanisms. In summary, our study identified lactadherin as a key player responsible for AGEs-induced EC apoptosis and antioxidants GSPB2 and resveratrol protect against AGEs-induced EC apoptosis by inhibiting lactadherin.

The presence of acrylamide has been proven in numerous kinds of food; fried potatoes and cereal based products contained significant levels. Approximately one third of human daily energy intake is food with a higher content of acrylamide, which gives rise to high loading. It effects as neurotoxin in human organism and is suspected to be genotoxic and carcinogenic to humans. In a relatively short time since the detection of acrylamide in human nutriment, many of scientific studies focused on contaminated food. Many indefinite findings resulted from all the data about its toxicity, negative effects and occurrence in biological materials. Based on former monitoring intent on the quantitative determination of acrylamide in food chain, we would like to emphasize the importance of additional studies on its occurrence in human milk and other biological fluids.

The technique allowed the identification of 72 TAGs in the samples analyzed. Similarities and differences among the TAGs fraction of human and donkey milk can be easily determined by HPLC analysis of the lipid fraction. Donkey milk presents TAGs with partition number (PN) values starting from 30 up to 50. In human milk, the short-chain fatty acids (FAs) are not well-represented and the PN values range between 36 and 52. Other significant differences are among TAGs containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). In fact, donkey milk presents a larger number and amount of ω3 and ω6 FAs than human milk, which contains only significant amount of ω6 FA (linoleic).

Because of the known effects of fatty acids on human health, the development of a quick, inexpensive, and accurate method to directly quantify the fatty acid (FA) composition in milk would be valuable for milk processors to develop a payment system for milk pertinent to their customer requirements and for farmers to adapt their feeding systems and breeding strategies accordingly. The aim of this study was (1) to confirm the ability of mid-infrared spectrometry (MIR) to quantify individual FA content in milk by using an innovative procedure of sampling (i.e., samples were collected from cows belonging to different breeds, different countries, and in different production systems); (2) to compare 6 mathematical methods to develop robust calibration equations for predicting the contents of individual FA in milk; and (3) to test interest in using the FA equations developed in milk as basis to predict FA content in fat without corrections for the slope and the bias of the developed equations. In total, 517 samples selected based on their spectral variability in 3 countries (Belgium, Ireland, and United Kingdom) from various breeds, cows, and production systems were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). The samples presenting the largest spectral variability were used to calibrate the prediction of FA by MIR. The remaining samples were used to externally validate the 28 FA equations developed. The 6 methods were (1) partial least squares regression (PLS); (2) PLS+repeatability file (REP); (3) first derivative of spectral data+PLS; (4) first derivative+REP+PLS; (5) second derivative of spectral data+PLS; and (6) second derivative+REP+PLS. Methods were compared on the basis of the cross-validation coefficient of determination (R2cv), the ratio of standard deviation of GC values to the standard error of cross-validation (RPD), and the validation coefficient of determination (R2v). The third and fourth methods had, on average, the highest R2cv, RPD, and R2v. The final equations were built using all GC and the best accuracy was observed for the infrared predictions of C4:0, C6:0, C8:0, C10:0, C12:0, C14:0, C16:0, C18:0, C18:1 trans, C18:1 cis-9, C18:1 cis, and for some groups of FA studied in milk (saturated, monounsaturated, unsaturated, short-chain, medium-chain, and long-chain FA). These equations showed R2cv greater than 0.95. With R2cv equal to 0.85, the MIR prediction of polyunsaturated FA could be used to screen the cow population. As previously published, infrared predictions of FA in fat are less accurate than those developed from FA content in milk (g/dL of milk) and no better results were obtained by using milk FA predictions if no corrections for bias and slope based on reference milk samples with known contents of FA were used.

While the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping the intestinal microbiota is limited. In this study, LAB were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in Syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in Syria. A total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and identified by comparative 16S rDNA sequencing and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analyses. Thirty six different species of Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Weissella and Pediococcus were identified. RAPD and MALDI-TOF-MS patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. Whereas some species were unique for one source, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. Interestingly, identical RAPD genotypes of L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis and P. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies.

Since human exposure to aflatoxins occurs primarily by contaminated food intake, and given the greater susceptibility of infants to their adverse effects, the quantification of these mycotoxins in infant food based on cereals is of relevance. Aflatoxin levels were determined in 91 Spanish infant cereals classified in terms of non- and organically produced and several types from 10 different manufacturers, using a extraction procedure followed by inmunoaffinity column clean-up step and HPLC with fluorescence detection (FLD) and post-column derivatisation (Kobra Cell system). Daily aflatoxin intake was also assessed. Preliminary analysis showed a valuable incidence of detected infant cereal samples at an upper concentration level than the detection limit for total aflatoxin (66%), corresponding to a 46, 40, 34 and 11% for AFB1, AFB2, AFG1 and AFG2, respectively. Lower aflatoxin values (median, Q1, Q3) in conventional infant cereal (n = 74, AFB1: <LOD (n.d.; 0.02), AFB2: n.d. (n.d.; 0.01), AFG1: <LOD (n.d.; 0.004), and AFG2: n.d.

In addition, five organic formulations (3.11, 1.98, 0.94, 0.47 and 0.21 µg kg(-1)) exceeded European AFB1 legislation (0.10 µg kg(-1)) versus two conventional cereals (0.35 and 0.12 µg kg(-1)). According to the type of infant cereal, those with cocoa had the highest aflatoxin levels. Gluten-free and cereals with dehydrated fruits had an intermediate level and milk- or honey-based cereals and multi-cereals contained the lowest levels. With the exception of the non-compliant cocoa-based organic formulation, none of the infant cereals analyzed gave a higher intake of 1 ng kg(-1) body weight per day, suggesting that infants fed on infant cereals are exposed to a low health hazard.

The handling and storage of human milk introduce the risk of degradation to expressed human milk and infant formula. In following a 20-minute simulated feeding, Vitamin C has been found to degrade. Vitamin C acts as an anti-oxidant and is responsible for shielding other nutrients from oxidation, such as retinol and alpha-tocopherol. By analyzing a 20-minute simulated feeding, retinol and alpha-tocopherol each displayed decreases over time significantly different than that of the Control, which was milk not exposed to bottle feeding. In human milk, retinol showed as high as a 9.5% decrease compared to the Control. Similar trends were seen with the infant formula samples. The correlation between degradation and bottle feeding systems was dependent upon the formation of bubbles in the milk as the milk was removed from the bottle. The analysis indicated a decrease of up to 12%, as seen in retinol, and 35%, as seen in alpha-tocopherol. These decreases in retinol and alpha-tocopherol should be considered when using a bottle feeding system to deliver either human milk or formula to an infant.

We established a standard protocol of glycoblotting-based O-glycomics in combination with nonenzymatic chemical treatment to release reducing O-glycans predominantly from various glycoprotein samples. It was demonstrated that the nonreductive condition employing a simple ammonium salt, ammonium carbamate, made glycoblotting-based enrichment analysis of O-glycans possible without significant loss or unfavorable side reactions. A general workflow of glycoblotting using a hydrazide bead (BlotGlyco H), on-bead chemical manipulations, and subsequent mass spectrometry allowed for rapid O-glycomics of human milk osteopontin (OPN) and urinary MUC1 glycoproteins purified from healthy donors in a quantitative manner. It was revealed that structures of O-glycans in human milk OPN were varied with habitual fucosylation and N-acetyllactosamine units. It was also suggested that purified human urinary MUC1 was modified preferentially by sialylated O-glycans (94% of total) with 7:3 ratio of core 1 to core 2 type O-glycans. Versatility of the present strategy is evident because this method was proved to be suited for the enrichment analysis of general biological and clinical samples such as human serum and urine, cultured human cancer cells, and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections.

Quantitative analyses yielded ∼7 times more GAGs in human milk than in bovine milk. In particular, galactosaminoglycans, chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS), were found to differ considerably from one type of milk to the other.

20712324,"Protein phosphorylation plays a key role in most cellular processes. Studying phosphopeptides in complex biological samples has been a great challenge due to their low abundance as well as the coexistence of excessive amounts of salts or surfactants. In this work we demonstrate a general approach for selective separation of phosphopeptides using a class of novel mesoporous nanostructured materials. TiO(2) nanocrystals are first self-assembled into submicrometer clusters containing relatively uniform mesoscale pores and then stabilized by coating with a thin layer of silica. Calcination of the materials at high temperatures connects the neighboring nanocrystals together and enhances the mechanical stability of the clusters and at the same time removes the organic surfactants and makes the TiO(2) surface fully accessible to phosphopeptides. By coating the nanocrystal clusters with a layer of silica before calcination and removing it afterward through chemical etching, we have been able to make the cluster surface hydrophilic and negatively charged, thus enhancing the water dispersibility of the clusters and eventually their accessibility to phosphopeptides. The high selectivity and capacity of these mesoporous TiO(2) clusters have been demonstrated by effectively enriching phosphopeptides from digests of phosphoprotein (alpha- or beta-casein), protein mixtures of beta-casein and bovine serum albumin, milk, and human serum samples. We also demonstrate that the self-assembly process brings the flexibility of incorporation of multiple components, such as superparamagnetic nanocrystals, to further facilitate the peptide separation.",Analytical chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002364', 'D002417', 'D005290', 'D006801', 'D053758', 'D010748', 'D016062', 'D012709', 'D012710', 'D019032', 'D014025', 'D014357']","['Animals', 'Caseins', 'Cattle', 'Ferric Compounds', 'Humans', 'Nanoparticles', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Porosity', 'Serum Albumin', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Titanium', 'Trypsin']",Mesoporous TiO(2) nanocrystal clusters for selective enrichment of phosphopeptides.,"[None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000378']","[None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20712324,2011,0

However, the biologically active components of donkey's milk have not yet completely elucidated. In this framework this study is aimed at measuring α-lactalbumin (α-LA), β-lactoglobulin (β-LG), and lysozyme (LYS), the principal whey proteins in donkey's milk, in relation to lactation stage and production season. Analysis were performed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. α-LA, β-LG, and LYS resulted to be affected by lactation stage (P < 0.01) and production season (P < 0.01). Overall, the protein content was higher (0.01 > P < 0.05) during the first four lactation's months and decreased until the month 8. The β-LG was the major protein (1.75 mg mL(-1) as mean; peak 2.24 ± 0.09 mg mL(-1)), while the α-LA had a mean concentration of 1.32 mg mL(-1) and peaked at month 1 (1.57 ± 0.09 mg mL(-1)) and LYS (0.66 mg mL(-1) as mean) showed the highest value equal to 0.76 ± 0.03 mg mL(-1).

The average recoveries of the different matrices were in general higher than 70% with a relative standard deviation (RSD) lower than 21% and method limits of detection (MLOD) ranging from 1.2 to 362 ng/L for the different compounds and matrices. The method was applied to investigate the occurrence of PFCs in 20 samples of human breast milk, and 5 samples of infant formulas and cereal baby food (3 brands of commercial milk infant formulas and 2 brands of cereals baby food). Breast milk samples were collected in 2008 from donors living in Barcelona city (Spain) on the 40 days postpartum. Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluoro-7-methyloctanoic acid (i,p-PFNA) were predominant being present in the 95% of breast milk samples. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was quantified in 8 of the 20 breast milk samples at concentrations in the range of 21-907 ng/L. Commercial formulas and food were purchased also in 2009 from a retail store. The six PFCs were detected in all brands of milk infant formulas and cereals baby food analyzed, being perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), PFOS, PFOA and i,p-PFNA the compounds detected in higher concentrations (up to 1289 ng/kg). PFCs presence can be associated to possible migration from packaging and containers during production processes. Finally, based on estimated body weight and newborn intake, PFOS and PFOA daily intakes and risk indexes (RI) were estimated for the firsts 6 month of life.

AFM1 is a potential threat to human health owing to its toxic and carcino- genic effects. This study was aimed to investigate the level of AFM1 in raw and ultra-high-temperature pasteurized (UHT) milk samples. A total of 137 milk specimens (39 from goats, 53 from cows, and 45 from UHT marketmilks) were included to the study, and AFM1 levels were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Aflaprep M immunoaffinity column; R-Biopharm Rhone Ltd., Glasgow) method. AFM1 positivity was detected in 14 (35.8%) goat milk samples, in 46 (86.7%) cow milk samples and 33 (73.3%) UHT milk samples, with the levels ranging from 0.0021 microg/l to 0.8666 microg/I in raw milk, and from 0.001 microg/I to 0.059 microg/I in UHT milk samples.

Recently, prebiotic supplements of infant formula [short-chain galacto (scGOS)-, long-chain fructo (lcFOS)-oligosaccharides] showed preventive effects on atopic disease development. We aimed to define the direct immunologic effects of these oligosaccharides and of human (aHMOS) and cows' milk (aCMOS) acidic oligosaccharides and to investigate the systemic uptake of prebiotic supplements of infant formula and a specific pectin-derived acidic oligosaccharide hydrolysate (pAOS) in vitro. After assurance of LPS-free conditions (limulus assay, toll like receptor-2, -4 transfected human embryonic kidney-cells), in vitro-transfer through a CaCo-2 cell monolayer was measured using high-pH anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection. Direct effects on proliferation, cytokine-induction of cord blood mononuclear cells and modulation of allergen-specific CD4+ T-cell cytokine profiles from allergic and non-allergic individuals were investigated. Transfer of scGOS/lcFOS and pAOS in-vitro was detected with a rate of transfer of 4-14%, depending on the molecular size and structure. AHMOS induced IFN-γ and IL-10 but not the Th-2 cytokine IL-13 at physiologic concentrations (10-100 μg/ml) in cord blood, whereas aCMOS did not induce any of these cytokines. AHMOS significantly suppressed Th-2 type cytokine-production by Ara h1-specific CD4+ T cells (CFSE(low) CD3(+) CD4(+) cells) from peanut allergic patients. In conclusion, human milk-derived acidic oligosaccharides may modulate postnatal allergen-specific immune responses by the suppression of Th-2-type responses in atopy-prone individuals.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in physiological fluids are biomarkers of exposure that present numerous challenges for sample collection and analysis. To date, a thorough evaluation of methods for collection and analysis of breast milk samples for volatiles has not been conducted. In this paper, we describe the development and validation of methods for collecting, storing, and analyzing 36 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breast milk to assess VOC exposure of lactating women and nursing infants.

The clean-up process was optimized using seven standard phosphatidylcholines including two lyso derivatives. Different acidic conditions were tested for the bonding and washing steps; for elution, various aqueous or methanolic bases were studied. Experiments were conducted hydrodynamically using extraction cartridges, and statically in batch mode; the performance of the sorbent was significantly better when used in the flow-through mode. The developed clean-up procedure was used to selectively enrich phosphatidylcholines from whole milk, human plasma, and mouse plasma, to show the wide applicability of the method. For the preceding extraction of total lipids from the matrix, different solvent mixtures (methanol-chloroform, methanol-methyl tert-butyl ether, and ethanol-ethyl acetate) were compared.

20140974,"We present the first evidence that electrophoretically and immunologically homogeneous sIgAs purified from milk of healthy human mothers by chromatography on Protein A-Sepharose and FPLC gel filtration contain intrinsically bound metal ions (Ca  >  Mg ≥ Al > Fe approximately  Zn ≥ Ni ≥ Cu ≥ Mn), the removal of which by a dialysis against ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) leads to a significant decrease in the β-casein-hydrolyzing activity of these antibodies (Abs). An affinity chromatography of total sIgAs on benzamidine-Sepharose interacting with canonical serine proteases separates a small metalloprotease sIgA fraction (6.8 ± 2.4%) from the main part of these Abs with a serine protease-like β-casein-hydrolyzing activity. The relative activity of this metalloprotease sIgA fraction containing intrinsically bound metal ions increases ∼1.2-1.9-fold after addition of external metal ions (Mg(2+) > Fe(2+) > Cu(2+) ≥ Ca(2+) ≥ Mn(2+)) but decreases by 85 ± 7% after the removal of the intrinsically bound metals. The metalloprotease sIgA fraction free of intrinsic metal ions demonstrates a high β-casein-hydrolyzing activity in the presence of individual external metal ions (Fe(2+) > Ca(2+) > Co(2+) ≥ Ni(2+)) and especially several combinations of metals: Co(2+) + Ca(2+) < Mg(2+) + Ca(2+) < Ca(2+) + Zn(2+) < Fe(2+) + Zn(2+) < Fe(2+) + Co(2+) < Fe(2+) + Ca(2+). The patterns of hydrolysis of a 22-mer oligopeptide corresponding to one of sIgA-dependent specific cleavage sites in β-casein depend significantly on the metal used. Metal-dependent sIgAs demonstrate an extreme diversity in their affinity for casein-Sepharose and chelating Sepharose, and interact with Sepharoses bearing immobilized monoclonal mouse IgGs against λ- and κ-type light chains of human Abs.

Macedocin was produced when the strain was grown in milk but not in MRS or M17 broth. No autoinduction mechanism was observed. Production did not depend on the presence of lactose or galactose in the culture medium or on a coculture of the producer strain with macedocin-sensitive or macedocin-resistant strains. Induction seemed to depend on the presence of one or more heat-stable protein components produced when S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 was grown in milk. The partial purification of the induction factor was performed by a combination of chromatography methods, and its activity was confirmed by a reverse transcription-PCR approach (RT-PCR).

We hypothesized that adding whole milk or sugar and nondairy creamer to instant coffee might modulate the bioavailability of coffee phenolics. Nine healthy participants were asked to randomly drink, in a crossover design, instant coffee (Coffee); instant coffee and 10% whole milk (Milk); or instant coffee, sugar, and nondairy creamer already premixed (Sugar/NDC). All 3 treatments provided the same amount of total CGA (332 mg). Blood was collected for 12 h after ingestion and plasma samples treated using a liquid-liquid extraction method that included a full enzymatic cleavage to hydrolyze all CGA and conjugates into phenolic acid equivalents. Hence, we focused our liquid chromatography-Electrospray ionization-tandem MS detection and quantification on caffeic acid (CA), ferulic acid (FA), and isoferulic acid (iFA) equivalents. Compared with a regular black instant coffee, the addition of milk did not significantly alter the area under the curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), or the time needed to reach C(max) (T(max)). The C(max) of CA and iFA were significantly lower and the T(max) of FA and iFA significantly longer for the Sugar/NDC group than for the Coffee group. However, the AUC did not significantly differ.

19723552,"Initially the resistance to digestion of two cow's milk allergens, beta-casein, and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg), was compared using a ""high-protease assay"" and a ""low-protease assay"" in a single laboratory. The low-protease assay represents an alternative standardised protocol mimicking conditions found in the gastrointestinal tract. For the high-protease assay, both proteins were incubated with either pepsin or pancreatin and digestion monitored by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography. The low-protease assay involved gastroduodenal digestion in the presence or absence of phosphatidylcholine (PC). Both beta-casein and beta-Lg were susceptible to hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin in the high-protease assay. In contrast, the kinetics of beta-casein digestion in the low-protease assay were slower, beta-Lg being pepsin resistant. During duodenal digestion, beta-Lg was gradually degraded and addition of PC slowed digestion.

19709866,"The influence of two different dietary patterns on maternal fatty acid (FA) intake on the composition of umbilical cord blood plasma phospholipids and transitional breast milk was investigated. A 7-day dietary record was completed in the last trimester of pregnancy by women living in an inland and a coastal area of south-eastern China. The FA composition in maternal diet was calculated using the 2002 Chinese food composition database. Cord blood and transitional breast milk samples were collected and their FA composition was analyzed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography. Mothers in the coastal area showed higher intake of long-chain polyunsaturated FA (LCPUFA) including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6omega) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA,20:5omega3) but lower linoleic acid (LA, 18:2omega6) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3omega3) than the mothers in the inland area. The intake of arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4omega6) did not differ between the two areas. LA, ALA, AA and DHA in breast milk of day 5 reflected the maternal diet except that the EPA content in breast milk at day 5 was similar for the areas. LA, ALA and AA were lower and EPA higher in umbilical cord plasma phospholipids in infants from the costal compared to the inland area. There were significant differences in maternal intakes of FA confirming different dietary habits, which influenced the FA composition of cord plasma phospholipids and transitional breast milk. Since FA influence gene expression the found variation implies that the long-term follow-up of this cohort will be interesting.","Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids","['D000328', 'D044466', 'D015331', 'D004032', 'D004041', 'D005227', 'D005247', 'D005260', 'D005312', 'D006801', 'D007231', 'D039382', 'D008895', 'D009035', 'D011247', 'D055815']","['Adult', 'Asian Continental Ancestry Group', 'Cohort Studies', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fats', 'Fatty Acids', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Milk, Human', 'Mothers', 'Pregnancy', 'Young Adult']","Fatty acid composition of diet, cord blood and breast milk in Chinese mothers with different dietary habits.","[None, None, None, None, 'Q000494', 'Q000032', 'Q000502', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000737', None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, 'pharmacology', 'analysis', 'physiology', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'drug effects', 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19709866,2010,0

However, residues of such compounds can still be found in the environment and in foodstuffs. Dairy products are an important exposure route for organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) to humans. For this reason, the presence of OCP residues in 233 dairy product samples; comprising milk, butter, cheese, labaneh and yoghurt collected from Jordan was determined. All samples were analyzed for their residual contents of aldrin, DDT and metabolites (DDTs), dieldrin, endosulfan isomers, endrin, hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (HCHs), heptachlor and HCB. Levels of these compounds were determined by gas chromatography with electron capture detector (GC-ECD). The results indicated that 9% (21/233), 8.5% (20/233), 6% (14/233) and 2.1% (5/233) of the examined samples were contaminated with beta-HCH, pp'-DDE, alpha-HCH and gamma-HCH, respectively. Heptachlor and alpha-endosulfan were only present in less than 2% of the analyzed samples. None of the samples revealed the presence of aldrin, op'-DDD, pp'-DDD, op'-DDE, op'-DDT, pp'-DDT, dieldrin, beta-endosulfan, endrin and HCB at their detection limits.

19609510,"Residual antimicrobials in food constitute a risk to human health. Although epidemiological data on the real magnitude of their adverse effects are very scarce, they indicate that food could be an important vehicle for evolution and dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Public health agencies in many countries rely on detection by mass spectrometry (MS) for unambiguous identification of residues of antimicrobial agents in animal food products for human consumption. The introduction of relatively inexpensive and robust liquid chromatography (LC)-MS systems has given a strong impulse to the development of confirmatory methods for the above medicines in foodstuffs. The initial part of this review, after a brief introduction into the field of antimicrobials, is dedicated to the most important EU regulations and directives for control of residues of these substances in animal products. The main attention in this review is on the sample-treatment and MS detection systems in use today for analysing the most important classes of antimicrobials in various biological matrices (milk, animal tissues, eggs, and honey). As evidenced by this review, reversed-phase LC combined with tandem MS, usually triple-quadrupole MS (QqQMS), is currently the preferred technique in most residue analysis of a single-class of antimicrobials. A recently emerging analytical strategy is that of developing methods for detecting a large variety of veterinary drugs belonging to different classes, including pesticides (multi-class residue analysis). To do this, simple and generic extraction and separation techniques applicable to a broad range of compounds differing in physical and chemical properties have been adopted. Such methods are still based mainly on LC-QqQMS. Emerging alternative MS detection systems are time-of-flight MS, which provides accurate mass of the analyte(s), or Q-linear ion trap (IT) MS that eliminates some limitations of ITMS(n).",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D000818', 'D000900', 'D002853', 'D004350', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D013058']","['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Drug Residues', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry']",Recent applications of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to residue analysis of antimicrobials in food of animal origin.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379']","[None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', None, 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19609510,2010,0

19452923,"Beef and dairy products can be important vectors of human exposure to polybrominated diphenylethers (BDEs), and hence an understanding of BDE transfer from feed to cows' milk and tissue is important for BDE exposure assessment The fate of tri- to hexaBDEs in lactating cows exposed to a naturally contaminated diet was studied by analyzing feed, feces, and milk samples from a mass balance study. Tissue distribution was studied in one cowslaughtered afterthe experiment The carryover rates from feed to milk ranged from 0.15 to 0.35 for the major congeners. Lower values were observed for several of the tetrabrominated congeners, and this was attributed to metabolism. The dietary absorption efficiency decreased with increasing octanol-water partition coefficient of the BDE congener. The absorption behavior was consistent with a model based on chemical lipophilicity, but agreed less well with a model based on effective molecular diameter, and it violated Lipinski's ""rule of 5"". The lipid normalized concentrations were similar in all tissues analyzed including liver and milk, suggesting that tissue distribution is governed by partitioning into lipids. Overall, the behavior of the tri- to hexaBDEs was consistent with that observed for other classes of halogenated aromatic contaminants such as PCBs and PCDD/Fs, but it differed markedly from the behavior of the hepta- decaBDEs.",Environmental science & technology,"['D000821', 'D000818', 'D002417', 'D005260', 'D007408', 'D007774', 'D013058', 'D008892', 'D011075', 'D014018']","['Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Female', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Lactation', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Milk', 'Polybrominated Biphenyls', 'Tissue Distribution']",A mass balance of tri-hexabrominated diphenyl ethers in lactating cows.,"['Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None]","['analysis', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19452923,2009,0

19419911,"Downstream purification of a model recombinant protein (human myelin basic protein) from milk of transgenic cows is described. The recombinant protein was expressed as a His tagged fusion protein in the milk of transgenic cows and was found associated with the casein micellar phase. While difficulties in obtaining good recoveries were found when employing conventional micelle disruption procedures, direct capture using the cation exchanger SP Sepharose Big Beads was found successful in the extraction of the recombinant protein. Early breakthrough suggested a slow release of the recombinant protein from the micelles and dictated micelle disruption in order to obtain good yields. A new approach for deconstruction of the calcium core of the casein micelles, employing the interaction between the micellar calcium and the active sites of the cation exchanger resin was developed. Milk samples were loaded to the column in aliquots with a column washing step after each aliquot. This sequential loading approach successfully liberated the recombinant protein from the micelles and was found superior to the conventional sample loading approach. It increased the recovery by more than 25%, reduced fouling due to milk components and improved the column hydrodynamic properties as compared to the conventional sample loading approach. Hardware and software modifications to the chromatography system were necessary in order to keep the whole process automated.

The level of oligomerization depends on the concentration of LF, KCl or NaCl, and on the duration of the protein storage in solution. At the concentrations comparable with those in human milk (1-6 mg/ml), the average radius of gyration (R(g)) values of LF can attain 400-480 A, while fresh solution of previously lyophylized LF demonstrate a lower average R(g) (50-100 A), and R(g) value characterizing the LF monomer formed at 1 M NaCl is 26.7 A. The addition of oligonucleotides, oligosaccharides, or mononucleotides to LF in the presence or in the absence of KCl with different level of initial oligomerization accelerates the oligomerization rate and increases the R(g) values up to approximately 600-700 A, which correspond to associates containing ten or more protein molecules. During gel filtration on Sepharose 4B, high-degree LF oligomers dissociate nearly completely forming different degraded complexes, but in some cases it is possible to reveal small amount of a decamer.

While cis-configurated isomers belong to the classic fatty acids of food, trans-fatty acids are suspected to pose a risk to human health. In either case, a thorough assessment of both positional and geometrical isomers of MUFAs is an important task in food and life sciences. For this purpose, a method suitable for routine analysis was developed. After lipid extraction and conversion of fatty acids into corresponding fatty acid methyl esters, cis and trans isomers of MUFAs were separated on silver-ion-impregnated cartridges. Fractions containing either cis- or trans-MUFAs were determined by gas chromatography-electron ionization mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring (GC/EI-MS-SIM) mode using [M-32](+) as quantification ions and [M-74](+) as well as M(+) as qualifier ions. A total of 14 MUFAs were available as reference standards, but a total of 40 MUFAs (22 cis and 18 trans isomers) were identified with high selectivity in samples of cheese, goat fat, human milk, and cod liver oil. The 18:1 and 16:1 isomers contributed most to both the cis- and trans-MUFAs. Application of internal standards allowed for the quantification of MUFAs only in the food samples. The amount of trans-fatty acids was determined to be 0.9- 4.3 g/100 g, with the lowest levels in human milk fat and the highest levels in Roquefort cheese.

The major isomers in human milk from the northern region were vaccenic and rumenic acids, whereas the other regions had a random distribution of these isomers. This was consistent with the isomer distribution in the refined vegetable oils used and their increased formation during high temperature stir-frying. The human milk composition showed little evidence that partially hydrogenated fats were consumed, except eight mothers in Guangzhou who reported eating crackers, plus four other mothers. The TFA concentration in these human milk samples was higher (2.06-3.96%). The amount of n-6 (1.70-2.24%) and n-3 (0.60-1.47%) highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) in human milk and the resultant ratio (1.43-2.95) showed all mothers in China had an adequate supply of HUFA in their diet. Rapeseed oil was consumed evidenced by erucic acids in human milk. The levels of erucic acid were below internationally accepted limits for human consumption. The levels of undesirable TFA and CLA isomers in human milk are a concern. Efforts to decrease the practice of high temperature stir-frying using unsaturated oils, and a promotion to increase consumption of dairy and ruminant products should be considered in China.",Lipids,"['D002681', 'D002849', 'D004883', 'D005231', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D044243', 'D008895', 'D011795', 'D044242']","['China', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Erucic Acids', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Linoleic Acids, Conjugated', 'Milk, Human', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Trans Fatty Acids']","Evaluating the trans fatty acid, CLA, PUFA and erucic acid diversity in human milk from five regions in China.","[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032']","[None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19184161,2009,0

In an effort to develop an efficient system for production of recombinant hLf (rhLf) that is structurally and functionally equivalent to the natural protein, we generated a recombinant CELO (chicken embryo lethal orphan) avian adenovirus containing an expression cassette for hLf. Embryonated chicken eggs were infected with the generated CELO-Lf virus. rhLf expression was measured in the allantoic fluid of infected eggs by ELISA three days later. The level of recombinant protein was about 0.8mg per embryo. rhLf was efficiently purified (up to 85% yield) from the allantoic fluid of infected eggs using affinity chromatography. rhLf produced in the allantoic fluid was characterized in comparison with natural hLf (nhLf) purified from human breast milk. SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and glycosylation analyzes showed that the recombinant protein had similar physical characteristics to nhLf. In addition, we demonstrated that the antioxidative and antimicrobial activity of rhLf produced in this system is equivalent to that of nhLf. Taken together, these results illustrate the utility of the described ""recombinant CELO adenovirus-chicken embryo"" system for production of functionally active rhLf.

The aim of the present study was to elucidate how cadmium is transported to breast milk by assessing interactions with essential micronutrients. The study is nested into a food and micronutrient supplementation trial conducted among pregnant women in Matlab, a rural area in Bangladesh, where malnutrition is prevalent and the cadmium exposure is relatively high. We measured cadmium in breast milk (BM-Cd; median 0.14 microg/kg; range <0.050-1.0 microg/kg), in erythrocytes (Ery-Cd; median 1.5 microg/kg; range 0.46-4.8 microg/kg) and in urine (U-Cd; median 0.63 microg/L; range 0.050-4.5 microg/L), using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). We found a significant positive association between Ery-Cd and BM-Cd and a breast milk-plasma ratio of approximately 3-4, indicating no barrier against cadmium transport from plasma to breast milk. BM-Cd was positively associated with manganese (r(s)=0.56; p<0.01) and iron (r(s)=0.55; p<0.01) in breast milk, but not with plasma ferritin. On the other hand, BM-Cd was negatively associated with BM-Ca (r(s)=-0.17; p=0.05), indicating that cadmium inhibits the transport of calcium to breast milk.

For extraction, 11.0 mL of the aqueous sample containing TCNs and 0.05 M Na(2)HPO(4) (9.1<or=pH<or=9.5) was filled into a 12.0-mL vial. The solution of 1-octanol (containing 10% (w/v) of Aliquat-336 as carrier) was immobilized in the pores of a porous polypropylene hollow fiber. Aqueous receiving phase (RP, 24 microL of 0.1M H(3)PO(4) and 1.0M NaCl with pH=1.6) was located inside the lumen of hollow fiber and the fiber was transferred into the aqueous sample. After the extraction period, the receiving phase was directly injected into HPLC. In order to obtain high extraction efficiency, the parameters affecting the liquid phase microextraction were evaluated and optimized. Under the optimized conditions, the calibration curves were linear in the range of 0.5-1,000 microgL(-1) for TCN and OTCN, and in the range of 5-1,000 microgL(-1) for DCN with good linearity (r(2)>0.995). Finally, applicability of the proposed method was successfully confirmed by extraction and determination of the drugs in water and plasma samples as well as in bovine milk samples with low and high fat contents. Comparing to the traditional methods, the proposed method exhibits high sensitivity and high preconcentration factors as well as good precision.

Six variants per species were used, each with a different concentration level of PFOA and PFOS (from 0.25 to 50 mg/kg as aqueous solution) to detect possible concentration dependence in the transfer of these two PFCs from soil to plant. PFOA and PFOS were detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry after appropriate sample preparation (partial drying, mincing, homogenizing, extraction). Since PFOA and PFOS presently represent the most widely studied PFCs, they are classified as ""leading compounds."" The results show that concentrations of PFOA/PFOS in the plants vary greatly, depending on the concentrations applied to the soil. PFOA values were higher than PFOS values in all plants except potatoes, in which these differences could be quite substantial. From the results presented here it can be seen that uptake and storage are much more intensive in the vegetative portion of the plant than relocation in the storage organs. This is particularly evident from the the comparison of concentrations found in the grain and ear and those in the straw or rest of the plant in spring wheat, oats, and maize. Transfer from ""soil to crops"" provides a possible explanation for the presence of PFCs in foodstuffs and in human body fluids such as blood, plasma, serum, or breast milk.

Some compounds, such as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), come partly from the mother's diet and are produced by the mother's body and secreted into the milk. Although several studies have examined the effect of chronic CLA supplementation on breast milk CLA appearance, little is known about the transfer of food CLA to breast milk over the short term. The objective of this study was to conduct a preliminary analysis of the kinetics of CLA appearance in breast milk over the short term. Seven women expressed breast milk at 4- to 6-hour intervals for 2 days after eating either CLA-enriched (1912 mg CLA) or control (231 mg CLA) cookies. Milk samples were freeze-dried, fatty acid methyl esters were prepared using methanolic-potassium hydroxide (KOH), and CLA isomers were quantified by gas chromatography. Analysis revealed the following: (1) CLA enrichment of total fatty acids in the breast milk for 48 hours post ingestion of the CLA-enriched cookies was 2.9-fold above control; (2) total breast milk CLA content for 48 hours post CLA-enriched cookies ingestion was 46% greater than post CLA-moderate cookies ingestion; (3) after ingestion of the CLA-enriched cookies, breast milk CLA enrichment plateaued between 8 to 28 hours. This preliminary study suggests that breast milk fatty acids are enriched in CLA compared to control within 28 hours after the ingestion of a CLA-rich food product and invites further research on the extent and timing with which breast milk composition reflects dietary CLA content.","Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)","['D000328', 'D004032', 'D002149', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D007700', 'D044243', 'D008875', 'D008895', 'D010865']","['Adult', 'Diet', 'Energy Intake', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Linoleic Acids, Conjugated', 'Middle Aged', 'Milk, Human', 'Pilot Projects']",Human breast milk enrichment in conjugated linoleic acid after consumption of a conjugated linoleic acid-rich food product: a pilot study.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000008', None, 'Q000737', None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'administration & dosage', None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19083443,2009,0

Here, we evaluated the proteomic analysis of milk samples following a strong anion exchange fractionation procedure using denaturating conditions ensuring the disruption of protein-protein interactions. Crude whey or skim milk and their different resulting fractions were analyzed by protein chip array mass spectrometry. Using protein chip array mass spectrometry, several high-abundance proteins were localized in distinct fractions increasing the total number of unique peptides and proteins detected. This total number increased by about 20-30% by combining different chromatographic surface arrays used for capture. Reproducible results were obtained in human skim milk and whey; however this approach was not successful with milk fat globule membrane and required refinement. Hence, milk profiling by anion exchange fractionation combined to protein chip array mass spectrometry represents a promising tool to detect unknown low-abundance milk proteins that may ultimately prove useful as biomarkers of diseases transmitted by breastfeeding.","Journal of chromatography.

19006329,"A specific state of the human milk Ca(2+) binding protein alpha-lactalbumin (hLA) complexed with oleic acid (OA) prepared using an OA-pretreated ion-exchange column (HAMLET) triggers several cell death pathways in various tumor cells. The possibility of preparing a hLA-OA complex with structural and cytotoxic properties similar to those of the HAMLET but under solution conditions has been explored. The complex was formed by titration of hLA by OA at pH 8.3 up to OA critical micelle concentration. We have shown that complex formation strongly depends on calcium, ionic strength, and temperature; the optimal conditions were established. The spectrofluorimetrically estimated number of OA molecules irreversibly bound per hLA molecule (after dialysis of the OA-loaded preparation against water followed by lyophilization) depends upon temperature: 2.9 at 17 degrees C (native apo-hLA; resulting complex referred to as LA-OA-17 state) and 9 at 45 degrees C (thermally unfolded apo-hLA; LA-OA-45). Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements revealed substantially decreased thermal stability of Ca(2+)-free forms of HAMLET, LA-OA-45, and OA-saturated protein. The irreversibly bound OA does not affect the Ca(2+) association constant of the protein. Phase plot analysis of fluorimetric and CD data indicates that the OA binding process involves several hLA intermediates. The effective pseudoequilibrium OA association constants for Ca(2+)-free hLA were estimated. The far-UV CD spectra of Ca(2+)-free hLA show that all OA-bound forms of the protein are characterized by elevated content of alpha-helical structure. The various hLA-OA complexes possess similar cytotoxic activities against human epidermoid larynx carcinoma cells. Overall, the LA-OA-45 complex possesses physicochemical, structural, and cytotoxic properties closely resembling those of HAMLET.

To study human milk casein phosphoforms, we applied traditional two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic (2-DE) separation combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) tandem mass spectroscopic analysis. The abundant beta-casein was resolved as a train of 6 spots differing in phosphorylation level with 0-5 phosphates attached. To study the less abundant alpha S1-casein, a cysteine-tagging enrichment treatment was used prior to 2-DE. A train of 9 spots with 4.4 < p I < 5.3 were identified as alpha S1-casein. This included five previously uncharacterized phosphoforms with up to 8 phosphate groups located in two serine-rich tryptic phosphopeptides ( (27)L-R (51), (69)N-K (98)) consistent with alpha-caseins from various ruminant species. MS/MS analysis of the phosphopeptides released by tryptic digestion enabled identification of the residue-specific order of phosphorylation among the 6 beta-casein and 9 alpha S1-casein phosphoforms. Deamidation of N (47) of alpha S1-casein was also a feature of the MS analysis. This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of the human casein phosphoproteome and reveals a much higher level of phosphorylation than previously recognized. It also highlights the advantages of 2-DE for examining the global pattern of protein phosphoforms and the limitations of attempting to estimate phosphorylation site occupancies from ""bottom-up"" studies.",Journal of proteome research,"['D000595', 'D002364', 'D015180', 'D006801', 'D008895', 'D008969', 'D010766', 'D020033', 'D020543', 'D019032']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Caseins', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Humans', 'Milk, Human', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteome', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",Analysis of the human casein phosphoproteome by 2-D electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS reveals new phosphoforms.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379']","[None, 'analysis', 'methods', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18847231,2009,0

It has been suggested that milk oligosaccharides are an important source of complex carbohydrates as supplements for the food and the pharmaceutical industries. However, only a small number of structures of bovine milk oligosaccharides (bMO) are known. There have been no systematic studies on bMO. High-performance mass spectrometry and separation methods are used to evaluate bMO, and nearly 40 oligosaccharides are present in bovine milk. Bovine milk oligosaccharides are composed of shorter oligomeric chains than are those in human milk. They are significantly more anionic with nearly 70%, measured abundances, being sialylated. Additionally, bMO are built not only on the lactose core (as are nearly all human milk oligosaccharides), but also on lactose amines.

18703753,"The discovery of drugs that can be used for the treatment of allergic disease is important in human health. Arctium lappa Linne (Compositae) (AL) has been used as a traditional medicine in Brazil and throughout Asia and is known to have an anti-inflammatory effect. In this study, the inhibitory effects of AL on degranulation and the release of mediators as well as on inhibition of cys-leukotriene biosynthesis by basophils were investigated. AL was selected out of 10,000 herbal extracts in a set-up for high throughput screening in which the degree of degranulation was monitored by the release of beta-hexosaminidase from rat basophil leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. The AL extract significantly reduced degranulation and biosynthesis of cys-leukotrienes of human basophils in peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs) (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 8.3 and 11.4 microg/ml, respectively). Viability and metabolic activity of the PBMCs were not affected. Although arctiin, the active component of AL that has been described in the literature, was not able to reduce degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells, a single high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fraction from the AL extract inhibited beta-hexosaminidase release (IC(50) = 22.2 microg/ml). Topical administration of an aqueous extract of AL (5 mg/ear) on the ear of whey-sensitized mice 4 hrs before challenge with whey in the ear inhibited acute ear swelling by 50% in an in vivo cow's milk allergic model. The extract had no effect in this model when administered orally. In conclusion, the active component present in the active HPLC fraction of the AL extract was able to significantly reduce the release of inflammatory mediators through inhibition of degranulation and cys-leukotriene release in vitro. In addition, this active component was able to inhibit acute skin response in mice in vivo, indicating that AL is a very promising natural component for use in anti-allergic treatment.","Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)","['D000818', 'D018926', 'D000893', 'D031170', 'D015549', 'D001491', 'D005591', 'D002851', 'D004427', 'D004487', 'D006801', 'D007963', 'D015289', 'D051379', 'D010936', 'D051381']","['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Arctium', 'Basophil Degranulation Test', 'Basophils', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Ear Diseases', 'Edema', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Leukotrienes', 'Mice', 'Plant Extracts', 'Rats']",In vitro and in vivo anti-allergic effects of Arctium lappa L.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000187', None, None, 'Q000139', 'Q000139', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000096', None, 'Q000737', None]","[None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'drug effects', None, None, 'chemically induced', 'chemically induced', None, 'drug effects', 'biosynthesis', None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18703753,2009,0

18680946,"Cows' milk allergy is the most frequent food allergy in children, and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg) is a major allergen. Milk-based hypoallergenic ingredients are manufactured by enzymatic hydrolysis, a process that could be improved by the application of high-pressure treatments. This study showed that the treatment of beta-Lg dissolved in buffer with chymotrypsin and trypsin under high pressure for relatively short times accelerated proteolysis by leading to a rapid removal of the intact protein. The rapid proteolysis of the beta-Lg substrate under pressure led to the production, in 20 min, of hydrolysates with lower immunoglobulin (Ig) G binding than those produced in 8 h (chymotrypsin) or 48 h (trypsin) at atmospheric pressure. However, those hydrolysates retained some residual IgE-binding properties that could be traced to the preferential release, during the initial stages of proteolysis, of peptides containing IgE epitopes, such as (Val-41-Lys-60), (Leu-149-Ile-162), and (Ser-21-Arg-40). The formation of these fragments was favored when proteolysis was conducted under high pressure due to the preferential hydrolysis of Arg-40 and Arg-148 by trypsin, and Tyr-42 and Leu-149 by chymotrypsin, all located at the dimer interface of beta-Lg or very close to it.

A total of 166 full-term infants between birth and 1 year of age were recruited into soy formula, cow milk formula, or breast milk regimens according to their feeding histories. A total of 381 urine, 361 saliva, and 88 blood samples were collected at 382 visits. We used automated online solid-phase extraction coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) for measuring three isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, and equol) in urine, and used similar LC/MS/MS techniques for saliva and blood spots. Concentrations of daidzein and genistein were undetectable in most blood or saliva samples from children fed breast milk or cow milk formula. The proportion of non-detectable values was somewhat lower in urine than in the other matrices. Concentrations of equol were detectable only in a few urine samples. For both daidzein and genistein, urine contained the highest median concentrations, followed by blood and then saliva. Urinary concentrations of genistein and daidzein were about 500 times higher in the soy formula-fed infants than in the cow milk formula-fed infants. The correlations between matrices for either analyte were strikingly lower than the correlation between the two analytes in any single matrix. We did not find significant correlations between isoflavone concentrations and the levels of certain hormones in children fed soy formula.

The 10kF fraction was as effective as ascorbic acid (1:20 iron to ascorbic acid) in increasing the ferric iron solubility and uptake in Caco-2 cells. Further, gel filtration chromatography on peptide column led to co-elution of ferric reductase and iron solubilization activities at an apparent molecular mass of <1500Da.

Global release of N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides showed both to be highly sialylated, with bovine peak-lactating milk O-linked oligosaccharides presenting as mono- and disialylated core 1 oligosaccharides (Galbeta1-3GalNAcol), while human milk had core type 2 oligosaccharides (Galbeta1-3(GlcNAcbeta1-6)GalNAcol) with sialylation on the C-3 branch. The C-6 branch of these structures was extended with branched and unbranched N-acetyllactosamine units terminating in blood group H and Lewis type epitopes. These epitopes were also presented on the reducing terminus of the human, but not the bovine, N-linked oligosaccharides. The O-linked structures were found to be attached to the high molecular mass mucins isolated by agarose-polyacrylamide composite gel electrophoresis, where MUC1 and MUC4 were present. Analysis of bovine colostrum showed that O-linked core 2 oligosaccharides are present at the early stage (3 days after birth) but are down-regulated as lactation develops.

Strong ion signals for almost all the samples were obtained. The amount of liquid sample picked up by the needle is as small as pL or less, making PESI a promising non-invasive technique for detecting biomolecules in living systems such as cells.

Because of their widespread use and potential risk to human health, assessing human exposure to these compounds in breastfed infants is of interest. We developed a sensitive method, using a unique on-line solid-phase extraction-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system with peak focusing feature, to measure in human milk the concentrations of five parabens (methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, butyl-, and benzyl parabens), triclosan, and six other environmental phenols: bisphenol A (BPA); ortho-phenylphenol (OPP); 2,4-dichlorophenol; 2,5-dichlorophenol; 2,4,5-trichlorophenol; and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (BP-3). The method, validated by use of breast milk pooled samples, shows good reproducibility (inter-day coefficient of variations ranging from 3.5% to 16.3%) and accuracy (spiked recoveries ranging from 84% to 119% at four spiking levels). The detection limits for most of the analytes are below 1 ng mL(-1) in 100 microL of milk. We tested the usefulness of the method by measuring the concentrations of these twelve compounds in four human milk samples. We detected methyl paraben, propyl paraben, triclosan, BPA, OPP, and BP-3 in some of the samples tested. The free species of these compounds appear to be the most prevalent in milk.

This reaction leads to impairment and alteration of protein's function and has been implicated in atherothrombotic disease. However, the data regarding N-linked Hcy content in proteins are limited, mostly due to a lack of facile assays. Here I describe a new sensitive assay for the determination of protein N-linked Hcy and demonstrate its utility for individual proteins and biological fluids. N-linked Hcy is liberated from proteins by acid hydrolysis and converted to Hcy-thiolactone, which is then purified and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography on a cation exchange column. The quantification is by fluorescence after postcolumn derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde. Using this assay, the levels of N-linked Hcy in individual pure proteins were found to vary from as high as 0.470-0.515 mol/mol protein for human and equine ferritins to as low as 0.00006 mol/mol protein for chicken lysozyme. Hemoglobins from a variety of species contained more N-linked Hcy than did corresponding albumins (0.0127-0.0828 vs. 0.0027-0.0086 mol/mol).

In the present study, we demonstrate that free fatty acids (FFA) derived from the saponification of bovine whey cream lipids are active in vitro at inhibiting the germination of Candida albicans, a morphological transition associated with pathogenicity. This activity was found to be significantly increased when bovine FFA were enriched in non-straight-chain FFA. At low cell density, this non-straight-chain FFA-enriched fraction was also found to inhibit in a dose-dependant manner the growth of both developmental forms of C. albicans as well as the growth of Aspergillus fumigatus. Using an assay-guided fractionation, the main components responsible for these activities were isolated. On the basis of mass spectroscopic and gas chromatographic analysis, antifungal compounds were identified as capric acid (C10:0), lauroleic acid (C12:1), 11-methyldodecanoic acid (iso-C13:0), myristoleic acid (C14:1n-5), and gamma-linolenic acid (C18:3n-6). The most potent compound was gamma-linolenic acid, with minimal inhibitory concentration values of 5.4 mg/L for C. albicans and 1.3 mg/L for A. fumigatus, in standardized conditions.

The impact of plant oil supplements to diets containing different forages on caprine milk fatty acid composition was examined in two experiments using twenty-seven Alpine goats in replicated 3 x 3 Latin squares with 28 d experimental periods. Treatments comprised of no oil (control) or 130 g/d of sunflower-seed oil (SO) or linseed oil (LO) supplements added to diets based on grass hay (H; experiment 1) or maize silage (M; experiment 2). Milk fat content was enhanced (P<0.01) on HSO, HLO and MLO compared with the corresponding H or M control diets, resulting in 17, 15 and 14% increases in milk fat secretion, respectively.

In this study, milk composition was compared between control and transgenic goats expressing high levels (1-5 g/l) of recombinant human butyrylcholinesterase in the milk. Casein concentration, as evaluated by acid precipitation, was significantly reduced in the transgenic compared with the control goats throughout lactation (P < 0.01). Milk fatty acid composition for transgenic goats, as determined by gas chromatography, was found to have significantly fewer short chain fatty acids (P < 0.01) and more saturated fatty acids (P < 0.05) compared to controls, suggesting an overall metabolic stress and/or decreased expression of key enzymes (e.g. fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase).

However, as lactation progressed, a significant increase in Na and serum albumin concentrations and a decrease in K(+) concentration were found in the milk of transgenic goats, while control animals remained unchanged (P < 0.01). These findings suggest that: (a) high expression of recombinant proteins may be associated with a slow-down in other synthetic activities at the mammary epithelium, as evidenced by a reduced casein expression and a decreased de-novo synthesis of fatty acids; (b) the development of permeable tight junctions may be the main mechanism involved in the premature cessation of milk secretion observed in these transgenic goats.",Transgenic research,"['D000818', 'D030801', 'D002091', 'D005227', 'D006041', 'D006801', 'D008321', 'D008892', 'D008903', 'D011994']","['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Butyrylcholinesterase', 'Fatty Acids', 'Goats', 'Humans', 'Mammary Glands, Animal', 'Milk', 'Minerals', 'Recombinant Proteins']",Milk composition studies in transgenic goats expressing recombinant human butyrylcholinesterase in the mammary gland.,"[None, 'Q000235', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000201', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, 'genetics', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'genetics', None, 'enzymology', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18483775,2008,0

Liquid and powdered soy protein formulation samples, both whole and light, were digested using a conventional heating program on a hot-plate. The powdered samples were prepared according to the label instructions for human consumption. A 5.0-ml aliquot of the soy protein emulsion was transferred to a borosilicate Erlenmeyer and concentrated nitric and sulfuric acid added. After a digestion time of approximately 50 min, hydrogen peroxide was added and heating continued to give a final volume of approximately 5 ml; the colorless digests were then made up to 15.0 ml with deionised water. Residual acid content was determined by acid-base titration. Good agreement between measured and certified values for all analytes in a non-fat milk powder (NIST SRM 1549) indicated that the method was suitable for major and trace elements determination in soy protein formulations.","Food additives & contaminants.

One (2)-epicatechin glucuronide and three (2)-epicatechin sulfates were detected in urine excreted after the intake of the two cocoa beverages (CC-M and CC-W). The results show that milk does not significantly affect the total amount of metabolites excreted in urine. However, differences in metabolite excretion profiles were observed; there were changes in the glucuronide and sulfate excretion rates, and the sulfation position between the period of excretion and the matrix.

Previous studies showed that oral dosing of rat dams with TBT chloride leads to abnormal fetal and postnatal development. In this study, the tissue distribution and speciation of organotins in tissues were examined in dams, fetuses, and neonates following dosing of rat dams commencing on gestational day (GD) 8 by oral gavage with TBT in olive oil at 0, 0.25, 2.5, or 10 mg/kg body weight (BW)/d. Dams' body weights were significantly reduced by the 10-mg/kg BW/d TBT treatment. At GD20, there were no significant effects of any TBT treatment on pup weights, litter size, sex ratio, or tissue weights. However, at postnatal day (PND) 6 and 12, neonatal pup weights were reduced by the 10-mg/kg BW/d TBT treatment but tissue weights were unaffected, except for the liver weight of female pups, which was reduced by the 10-mg/kg BW/d TBT treatment. Tissues harvested on GD20 and PND6 and PND12 were extracted for determination of organotins by gas chromatography-atomic emission detection (GC-AED). In most tissues, TBT and its metabolite dibutyltin (DBT) were evident but monobutyltin (MBT) was rarely measured above the detection limit. The livers and brains of fetuses contained TBT and DBT at levels that were approximately 50% of the equivalent tissues in the dams. Furthermore, these tissues appeared to preferentially absorb/retain organotins, since the concentrations were greater than were found for the total loading in whole pups. The placenta also contained relatively large quantities of TBT and DBT. Postnatally, the TBT levels in pups decreased markedly, a probable consequence of the extremely low levels of organotins in rat milk. However, DBT levels in pups livers and brains were maintained, probably due to metabolism of TBT to DBT. Similarly, while dams' spleens contained significant quantities of organotins, the pups' spleens contained smaller quantities, and these decreased rapidly between PND6 and PND12. These results show that organotins cross the placenta and accumulate in fetal tissues but that during lactation, the pups would receive minimal organotins through the milk and during this period, the levels of TBT in pups' tissues decreases rapidly. Consequently, fetuses would be at greater risk of the adverse effects of TBT, but due to the lack of transfer through milk, the risk would be reduced during the lactational period.",Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

This study was undertaken to prepare recombinant hCMP without glycosylation using recombinant plasmid and prokaryotic expression system. The gene encoding hCMP was chemically synthesized and directly inserted into the pET28a(+) vector and then expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The maximum amount of soluble protein was obtained by incubation with 0.5 mM isopropyl-alpha-D-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 degrees C for 4 h and accounted for 40% of the total intracellular protein. Most of the expressed fusion proteins, located in the cell periplasm and cytoplasm, could be adsorbed by nickel affinity chromatography and eluted with buffer containing 300 mM imidazole.

18188738,"Human exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) is due to that found in the diet, and BPA and its metabolites were detected at parts per billion (or less) concentrations in human urine, milk, saliva, serum, plasma, ovarian follicular fluid, and amniotic fluid. Adverse health effects in mice and rats may be induced after parenteral injection or after massive oral doses. Controlled ingestion trials in healthy adult volunteers with 5 mg d16-BPA were unable to detect parent BPA in plasma despite exquisitely sensitive (limit of detection = 6 nM) methods, but by 96 h 100% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as the glucuronide. The extensive BPA glucuronidation following ingestion is not seen after parenteral injection; only the parent BPA binds plasma proteins and estrogen receptors (ER). The hypothesis that BPA dose-response may be described by a J- or U-shape curve was not supported by toxicogenomic data collected in fetal rat testes and epididymes (after repeated parenteral exposure at 2-400,000 microg/kg-d), where a clear monotonic dose-response both in the numbers of genes and magnitude of individual gene expression was evident. There is no clear indication from available data that the BPA doses normally consumed by humans pose an increased risk for immunologic or neurologic disease. There is no evidence that BPA poses a genotoxic or carcinogenic risk and clinical evaluations of 205 men and women with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-verified serum or urinary BPA conjugates showed (1) no objective signs, (2) no changes in reproductive hormones or clinical chemistry parameters, and (3) no alterations in the number of children or sons:daughters ratio. Results of benchmark dose (BMD10 and BMDL10) calculations and no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) inspections of all available and reproducible rodent studies with oral BPA found BMD and NOAEL values all greater than the 5 mg/kg-d NOAELs from mouse and rat multigeneration reproduction toxicity studies. While allometric and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models were constructed for interspecies scaling of BPA and its interaction with ER, multigeneration feeding studies with BPA at doses spanning 5 orders of magnitude failed to identify signs of developmental toxicity or adverse changes in reproductive tract tissues; the 5-mg/kg-d NOAELs identified for systemic toxicity in rats and mice were less than the oral NOAELs for reproductive toxicity. Thus, it is the generalized systemic toxicity of ingested BPA rather than reproductive, immunologic, neurobehavioral, or genotoxic hazard that represents the point of departure. Using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uncertainty factor guidance and application of a threefold database uncertainty factor (to account for the fact that the carcinogenic potential of transplacental BPA exposure has yet to be fully defined and comprehensive neurobehavioral and immunotoxicologic evaluations of BPA by relevant routes and at relevant doses have yet to be completed) to the administered dose NOAEL results in an oral RfD of 0.016 mg/kg-d.

18079281,"Human milk contains prebiotic oligosaccharides, which stimulate the growth of intestinal bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. It is unclear whether the prebiotic capacity of human milk contributes to the larger bile salt pool size and the more efficient fat absorption in infants fed human milk compared with formula. We determined the effect of prebiotic oligosaccharides on bile salt metabolism in rats. Rats were fed a control diet or an isocaloric diet containing a mixture of galactooligosaccharides (GOS), long-chain fructooligosaccharides (lcFOS), and acidified oligosaccharides (AOS) for 3 wk. We determined synthesis rate, pool size, and fractional turnover rate (FTR) of the primary bile salt cholate by using stable isotope dilution methodology. We quantified bile flow and biliary bile salt secretion rates through bile cannulation. Prebiotic intervention resulted in significant changes in fecal and colonic flora: the proportion of lactobacilli increased 344% (P < 0.01) in colon content and 139% (P < 0.01) in feces compared with the control group. The number of bifidobacteria also increased 366% (P < 0.01) in colon content and 282% in feces after the prebiotic treatment. Furthermore, pH in both colon and feces decreased significantly with 1.0 and 0.5 pH point, respectively. However, despite this alteration of intestinal bacterial flora, no significant effect on relevant parameters of bile salt metabolism and cholate kinetics was found.

Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that silymarin flavonolignans were rapidly eliminated with short half-lives (1-3 and 3-8 h for free and conjugated, respectively). The AUC(0-->infinity) values of the conjugated silymarin flavonolignans were 4- to 30-fold higher than those of their free fractions, with SB(B) (mean AUC(0-->infinity) = 51 and 597 microg x h/l for free and conjugated, respectively) and ISB(A) (mean AUC(0-->infinity) = 30 and 734 microg x h/l for free and conjugated, respectively) exhibiting higher AUC(0-->infinity) values in comparison with other flavonolignans.

17723381,"In recent years, many different water sources and foods have been reported to contain perchlorate. Studies indicate that significant levels of perchlorate are present in both human and dairy milk. The determination of perchlorate in milk is particularly important due to its potential health impact on infants and children. As for many other biological samples, sample preparation is more time consuming than the analysis itself. The concurrent presence of large amounts of fats, proteins, carbohydrates, etc., demands some initial cleanup; otherwise the separation column lifetime and the limit of detection are both greatly compromised. Reported milk processing methods require the addition of chemicals such as ethanol, acetic acid or acetonitrile. Reagent addition is undesirable in trace analysis. We report here an essentially reagent-free sample preparation method for the determination of perchlorate in milk. Milk samples are spiked with isotopically labeled perchlorate and centrifuged to remove lipids. The resulting liquid is placed in a disposable centrifugal ultrafilter device with a molecular weight cutoff of 10 kDa, and centrifuged. Approximately 5-10 ml of clear liquid, ready for analysis, is obtained from a 20 ml milk sample. Both bovine and human milk samples have been successfully processed and analyzed by ion chromatography-mass spectrometry (IC-MS). Standard addition experiments show good recoveries. The repeatability of the analytical result for the same sample in multiple sample cleanup runs ranged from 3 to 6% R.S.D.

17646876,"Most proteomics studies involving mapping post-translational modifications, such as the phosphorylation of serine and threonine, are performed today using the 'bottom-up' approach. This approach involves enzymatic cleavage of proteins, most often by trypsin, with subsequent nano-LC-MS/MS. The occupancy rates of phosphosites in proteins may differ by orders of magnitude, and thus the occupancy rate must be reported for each occupied phosphosite. To highlight potential pitfalls in quantifying the occupancy rates, alpha(s1)-casein from human milk was selected as a model molecule representing moderately phosphorylated proteins. For this purpose, human milk from one Caucasian woman in the eighth month of lactation was used. The phosphorylation level of caseins is believed to have major implications for the formation of micelles that are involved in delivering valuable calcium phosphate and other minerals to the new-born. Human alpha(s1)-casein has been reported to be much less phosphorylated than ruminant caseins, which may indicate a different function of caseins in humans. Revealing the phosphorylation pattern in human casein can thus shed light on its function. The current study found that the sequence region between the residues Ser70 and Ser76 in human alpha(s1)-casein is in fact phosphorylated, contrary to previous knowledge. The site of the most abundant phosphorylation is Ser75, in agreement with the known action of the mammary gland casein kinase. There is evidence for the second phosphorylation in that region, possibly at Ser73. Earlier reported positions of phosphorylations at Ser18 and Ser26 are also confirmed, but not the dominance of Ser18 phosphorylation. The occupancy rates at Ser18, Ser26 and Ser75 are estimated to be (7 +/- 2), (20 +/- 6) and (27 +/- 9)%, respectively. Owing to differences in the ionization efficiency between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides a 30% error margin is added to the occupancy rates. The highlighted pitfalls of the bottom-up strategy include the sensitivity of enzymes to proximal acidic and phosphorylated residues and the presence of multiple isoforms, including unexpected ones, of the tryptic peptides. The utility of the earlier introduced PhosTS_hunter and ModifiComb approaches for evading the latter pitfall is demonstrated.",The Analyst,"['D002364', 'D002853', 'D003627', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D008895', 'D010766', 'D040901', 'D012694', 'D013057']","['Caseins', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Milk, Human', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteomics', 'Serine', 'Spectrum Analysis']",On studying protein phosphorylation patterns using bottom-up LC-MS/MS: the case of human alpha-casein.,"['Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000378', None]","['analysis', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17646876,2007,0

They are also found at low levels in a range of foodstuffs, where their presence has been linked to bacterial sources. In this study we evaluated the potential of compound-specific isotope analysis to obtain insights into the stable carbon isotope ratios (delta(13)C values in per thousand) of individual MBFAs and to compare them to the stable carbon isotope ratios of straight-chain fatty acids in food. Due to their low abundance in foodstuffs, the MBFAs were enriched prior to gas chromatography coupled to isotope ratio mass spectrometric (GC-IRMS) analysis. After transesterification, urea complexation was used to suppress the 16:0 and 18:0 methyl esters that were dominant in the samples. Following that, silver-ion high performance liquid chromatography was used to separate the saturated from the unsaturated fatty acids. The resulting solutions of saturated fatty acids obtained from suet, goat's milk, butter, and human milk were studied by GC-IRMS. The delta(13)C values of fatty acids with 12-17 carbons ranged from -25.4 per thousand to -37.6 per thousand. In all samples, MBFAs were most depleted in carbon-13, followed by the odd-chain fatty acids 15:0 and 17:0. 14:0 and 16:0 contained the highest proportions of carbon-13. The results from this study illustrate that MBFAs have distinctive delta(13)C values and must originate from other sources and/or from very different substrates.

17582100,"Sensory and chemical consequences of treating goat milk using an UV fluid processor were assessed. Milk was exposed to UV for a cumulative exposure time of 18 s and targeted UV dose of 15.8 +/- 1.6 mJ/cm2. A triangle test revealed differences between the odor of raw milk and UV irradiated milk. Oxidation and hydrolytic rancidity was measured by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and acid degree values (ADV). As UV dose increased, there was an increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substance values and ADV of the milk samples. A separate set of samples were processed using the fluid processor but with no UV exposure to see if lipase activity and agitation from pumping contributed to the differences in odor. The ADV increased at the same rate as samples exposed to UV; however, sensory studies indicated that the increase of free fatty acids was not enough to cause detectable differences in the odor of milk. Solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography were utilized for the analysis of volatile compounds as a result of UV exposure. There was an increase in the concentration of pentanal, hexanal, and heptanal (relative to raw goat milk) after as little as 1.3 mJ/cm2 UV dose.

17508720,"Anteiso fatty acids (aFAs)-long-chain carboxylic acids with a methyl branch on the (n - 2)-carbon-are among the most simple fatty acids that are chiral. The most frequently occurring aFAs in food are 12-methyltetradecanoic acid (a15:0) and 14-methylhexadecanoic acid (a17:0), structures where the asymmetric carbon is more than 10 carbons separated from the polar head group. Previously, only enantioseparation of 4-methyl-substituted carboxylic fatty acids has been reported by gas chromatography. Here we present the first direct partial enantioresolution of synthesized racemic a15:0-a17:0 on a capillary column coated with 50% heptakis(6-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-2,3-di-O-methyl)-beta-cyclodextrin diluted in OV1701. Synthesized (S)-(+)-enantiomers were used to demonstrate that the elution order was (R)- prior to (S)-enantiomers. Using this system, food samples (butter, goat's milk fat, suet, human milk, seal oil, cod liver oil) known to contain aFAs were analyzed. Prior to the enantioselective gas chromatography, unsaturated fatty acids were preseparated by urea complexation, silver ion high performance liquid chromatography (Ag+-HPLC), or both from food samples. The fractions of the food samples enriched with methyl-branched fatty acids were then analyzed by GC/MS in the SIM mode. The measurements confirmed that the (S)-enantiomer of a15:0 (ee >96%), a16:0, and a17:0 (ee >90%, respectively) dominated in all samples. While the (R)-enantiomers could not be identified in samples from ruminants and human milk, their presence could be established in cod liver and seal oil (ee <86%).",Analytical chemistry,"['D000818', 'D002412', 'D002417', 'D002851', 'D003060', 'D005227', 'D005395', 'D005504', 'D008401', 'D006041', 'D006801', 'D008892', 'D010169', 'D046048', 'D012834', 'D013237', 'D014508', 'D047392']","['Animals', 'Cations', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cod Liver Oil', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fish Oils', 'Food Analysis', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Goats', 'Humans', 'Milk', 'Palmitic Acids', 'Seals, Earless', 'Silver', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Urea', 'beta-Cyclodextrins']",Enantioselective determination of anteiso fatty acids in food samples.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000295', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000295', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, None, None, 'instrumentation', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', 'instrumentation', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17508720,2007,0

These elements pollute the environment due to their widespread use as catalytic converters and in medical applications. The risk they pose to human health and the environment is still controversial; however, literature data point to diet as an important source of uptake by the human body. Within this context, the total Pd and Pt content of several Italian food commodities has been investigated. A total of 90 samples, including flour products, vegetables and foodstuffs of animal origin (meat, milk and eggs), were collected and freeze-dried. Samples were analyzed by sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS) after chopping or crushing followed by freeze-drying and microwave (MW)-assisted acid digestion in a Class-100 clean-room. A mathematical approach was adopted to correct the mass signals for still unresolved interference (mDeltam = 300, 10 000). The lowest and highest concentrations of Pt, i.e. 17 and 93 ng kg(-1) (dry weight, dw), were found in vegetables and flour products, respectively.

Foods are considered a constant source of exposure, despite compliance with maximum permitted residue levels. This study aimed to examine the relationship between nutritional habits of women in Southeast Spain and their serum concentrations of OCs. A semi-quantitative questionnaire was used to estimate the frequency of consumption of foods by two age groups of women, pre-menopausal (Pre-M) and post-menopausal (Post-M), and their serum pesticide levels were measured by gas chromatography (GC) with electron capture detector and confirmed by GC and mass spectrometry. The Pre-M group showed significantly higher serum concentrations of all OCs studied with the exception of DDE. The groups significantly differed in consumption of all food groups with the exception of fruit. In the Pre-M group, the mean serum p,p-DDT concentration was significantly associated with milk/yoghurt (p<0.045) and red meat (p<0.023), serum o,p-DDT with red meat (p<0.049), serum aldrin with eggs (p<0.038) and poultry (p<0.024), and serum DDE with eggs (p<0.025).

A good way to raise the CLA content in the diet without a radical change in eating habits seems to be the enrichment of commonly consumed food products with CLA supplements. This study analyzed the total fatty acid content and the CLA isomer composition of 6 commercially available CLA-fortified dairy products during processing and 10 wk of refrigerated storage. Research was carried out by combining gas chromatography and silver-ion HPLC. The tested samples were a CLA oil supplement, and several skim milk dairy products fortified with the supplement (milk, milk powder, fermented milk, yogurt, fresh cheese, and milk-juice blend). The CLA oil supplement was added such that the consumer received 2.4 g/d of CLA by consuming 2 servings. The predominant isomers present, C18:2 cis-9, trans-11 CLA and C18:2 cis-10, trans-12 CLA, were in at a similar ratio, which ranged from 0.97 to 1.05. These major isomers were not significantly affected by processing but a decrease in total CLA in fresh cheese samples was detected after 10 wk of refrigerated storage. Refrigerated storage and thermal treatment resulted in significant decreases or disappearance of some of the minor CLA isomers and a significant increase of trans, trans isomers from both cis, trans, trans, cis, and cis, cis isomers especially in CLA-fortified milk powder but also in fermented milk, yogurt, and milk-juice blend.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D002611', 'D002849', 'D002851', 'D005410', 'D005511', 'D005527', 'D007536', 'D044243', 'D008892', 'D013997']","['Animals', 'Cheese', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Flame Ionization', 'Food Handling', 'Food, Fortified', 'Isomerism', 'Linoleic Acids, Conjugated', 'Milk', 'Time Factors']",Hot topic: Fatty acid and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomer composition of commercial CLA-fortified dairy products: evaluation after processing and storage.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None]","[None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17430905,2008,0

Soy milks processed by UHT (143 degrees C/14 s, 143 degrees C/59 s, 154 degrees C/29 s) were compared to a control soy milk (90 degrees C/10 min) after 0, 1, and 7 days of storage (4.4 +/- 1 degrees C). Dynamic headspace dilution analysis (DHDA) and solvent-assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE) in conjunction with GC-olfactometry (GCO)/aroma extract dilution techniques and GC-MS were used to identify and quantify major aroma-active compounds. Sensory results revealed that intensities of overall aroma and sulfur and sweet aromatic flavors were affected by the processing conditions. Odorants mainly responsible for the changes in sulfur perception were methional, methanethiol, and dimethyl sulfide. Increases in 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, 2-acetyl-thiazole, and 2-acetyl-2-thiazoline intensities were associated with roasted aromas. A marginal increase in intensity of sweet aromatic flavor could be explained by increases in 2,3-butanedione, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, beta-damascenone, and 2- and 3-methylbutanal. Predominant lipid-derived odorants, including (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal, (E,E)-2,4-decadienal, (E,Z)-2,4-decadienal, (E)-2-nonenal, (E)-2-octenal, 1-octen-3-one, 1-octen-3-ol, and (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal, were affected by processing conditions.

17333152,"The developing human brain requires high amounts of sialic acids. While human milk is very rich in sialic acids, cow's milk based infant formulas provide lower amounts of sialic acids, and sialic acids are absent in soy milk based formulas. This has prompted interest in the supplementation of formulas with sialic acids, either free or bound to glycoconjugates. In order for fortification of infant formulas with sialic acids to be appropriate for the developmental needs of the infant, an accurate quantitation of sialic acid content of infant formulas through a reliable and easy-to-use method is, therefore, of great interest to industry. In the present method, we describe the application of one of the most widely used analytical techniques to the quantitation of sialic acids in infant formulas. Briefly, sialic acids are hydrolyzed from glycoconjugates, derivatized using 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene dihydrochloride (DMB), and separated using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The method fulfilled the established criteria for validation, with an interassay standard deviation of less than 5%, accuracy greater than 97%, and surrogate recovery between 98 and 104%. An investigation of the ruggedness of the method identified two key criteria: both standards and samples must be subjected to the same temperature and pH conditions for an accurate quantitation; and prolonged storage (more than 2 days) of the DMB reagent and derivatives must be avoided. In conclusion, this method is specific, straightforward, and accurate and can be easily performed in a quality-assurance laboratory to track the level of sialic acid in formulas that contain both inherent and fortified amounts of sialic acids.

These disorders highlight the application of new genetic tools for screening newborns for conditions managed by medical nutrition therapy. Early detection and dietary treatment have been crucial since the 1960s for patients diagnosed with phenylketonuria. The same concept of reducing the dietary substrate that accumulates in disease is applied today for some conditions difficult to diagnose a decade ago. More than 6,000 human single-gene disorders have been identified to date, including more than 100 protein-based metabolic disorders. Tandem mass spectrometry has facilitated newborn screening for more disorders at low cost and high speed. Presently, screening newborns for 29 disorders is recommended in the United States and many states are doubling or tripling the number of tests offered in their screening programs. Complex dietary therapies have evolved for rare disorders, such as fatty acid oxidation, urea cycle, organic acid metabolism, glycogen storage, and energy production. Diagnosis-specific therapy may challenge routine dietary recommendations, such as encouraging fatty and sugary foods or avoiding fruits and milk, and treatment options have spawned a market in special formulas and substitute foods; recommended references and Web sites are provided to assist food and nutrition professionals in navigating this territory.

Here, human GAA was expressed in the mammary gland of transgenic rabbits. The N-linked glycans of recombinant human GAA (rhAGLU), isolated from the rabbit milk, were released by peptide-N(4)-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase F. The N-glycan pool was fractionated and purified into individual components by a combination of anion-exchange, normal-phase, and Sambucus nigra agglutinin-affinity chromatography.

A modified lipid containing palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids, resembling the composition of human milk fat, was synthesized by enzymatic interesterification reactions between tripalmitin and a vegetable oil blend containing a 2.5:1.1:0.8 ratio of coconut, safflower, and soybean oils. A commercial sn-1,3-specific lipase obtained from Rhyzomucor miehei, Lipozyme RM IM, was used as the biocatalyst. The effects of substrate molar ratio and reaction time on the incorporation of palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids at the sn-2 position of the triacylglycerols were investigated. The fatty acid composition and sn-2 position of the experimental formulas were analyzed using gas chromatography. Results showed that the highest incorporation of palmitic acid was obtained at 12 h of incubation at 55 degrees C with a substrate molar ratio of 1:0.4 of tripalmitin to vegetable oil blend. However, the modified milk interesterified for 12 h at a 1:1 molar ratio had a greater resemblance to human milk compared with the other formulas. The level of oleic acid incorporation at the sn-2 position increased with the molar ratio of tripalmitin to vegetable oil blend.

17183076,"Rotavirus is a major cause of infantile viral gastroenteritis and can lead to severe and sometimes lethal dehydration. Previous studies have shown that breast-fed children are better protected against symptomatic infections, and that the milk fat globule protein lactadherin might be at least partly responsible for this effect. In vitro studies have shown that human lactadherin, in contrast to the bovine ortholog, could inhibit rotavirus infectivity, and that bovine MUC1 and a commercially available bovine macromolecular whey protein (MMWP) fraction proved to be effective. The present work describes the versatility of MMWP against the infection of 2 human intestinal cell lines (Caco-2 and FHs 74 Int) by 4 different rotavirus strains (Wa, RRV, YM, RF). Isolation of a protein fraction (CM3Q3) from MMWP that effectively inhibits rotavirus infectivity in vitro is documented. Purification was achieved by monitoring the rotaviral inhibitory activity in fractions obtained from 2 consecutive steps of ion-exchange chromatography. The major component of CM3Q3 was shown to be bovine IgG, and the attenuating capacity of this fraction is most properly linked to this component. The capacity of MMWP, MUC1, lactadherin, and the CM3Q3 fraction to inhibit the infectivity of the murine EMcN rotavirus strain was analyzed in adult BALB/c mice by using 2 different amounts of virus (10 and 100 times more than 50% the viral shedding doses). Only CM3Q3 was able to significantly affect the shedding of rotavirus in the stools of experimentally infected mice when the high viral dose was given. Detection of rotavirus-specific serum antibodies showed that the high dose infected all groups of mice. Experiments with the low dose of virus implied that all the tested milk proteins could affect the viral shedding in stools; in addition, use of MUC1, MMWP, and CM3Q3 prevented the appearance of serum viral antibodies. The advantages of using bovine immunoglobulins to induce passive immunity against rotavirus have been substantially investigated, although studies have mainly focused on the use of derivatives from immunized cows, especially colostrum.

Owing to analytical difficulties, several literature reports of chromium content of foods, especially for the lower levels, show large variability and should be interpreted with caution. Zeeman background correction, transversely heated graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry was used to determine the chromium content of 104 different infant formulae (cow's milk and soy protein based) marketed in Spain following an acid-digestion sample preparation procedure in a closed, pressurized and microwave digestion unit. The mean and range of chromium values, regarding types and main protein-based infant formulae are presented. Additionally, the influence of the type of container used, the impact of industrial process from different manufacturers and the physical state (powder and liquid formulae) on chromium levels is also discussed. In general, the infant formulae contain a higher chromium concentration than that found in human milk (reference range: 0.20-8.18 microg l-1), particularly in the case of hypoallergenic (18.16 +/- 7.89 microg l-1), lactose-free (11.37 +/- 3.07 microg l-1), pre-term (11.48 +/- 3.15 microg l-1) and soya (10.43 +/- 4.05 microg l-1) formulae.

Purified DAGE were converted into 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerols by pancreatic lipase, without isomerization, and transformed into 1-O-alkyl-2-oxoacyl-sn-glycerols by mild autooxidation. The various core aldehydes without derivatization, as well as the corresponding dinitrophenylhydrazones, were characterized by chromatographic retention time and diagnostic ions by online electrospray mass spectrometry. Core aldehydes of oxidized shark liver oil yielded 23 molecular species of 1-O-alkyl-sn-glycerols with short-chain sn-2 oxoacyl groups, ranging from 4 to 13 carbons, some unsaturated. Autooxidation of human milk fat yielded 1-O-octadecyl-2-(9-oxo)nonanoyl-sn-glycerol, as the major core aldehyde. Because diradylglycerols with short fatty chains are absorbed in the intestine and react with cytidine diphosphate-choline in the enterocytes, it is concluded that formation of such PAF mimics as 1-O-alkyl-2-(omega-oxo)acyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine from unsaturated dietary DAGE is a realistic possibility.

17054098,"According to epidemiologic studies, dietary phenolic antioxidants, such as chlorogenic acid (CQA), could prevent coronary heart diseases and some cancers. Coffee is the main source of CQA in the human diet. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of usual coffee consumption conditions, such as the addition of milk, on CQA bioavailability. Interactions between CQA and milk proteins were shown, using an ultrafiltration technique. These interactions proved to be slightly disrupted during an in vitro digestion process. CQA absorption and bioavailability were then studied in vitro using a Caco-2 cell model coupled with an in vitro digestion process, and in vivo, in a chronic supplementation study in which rats were fed daily coffee or coffee and milk for 3 weeks.

17033000,"The occurrence of calcium lactate crystals (CLC) in hard cheeses is a continual expense to the cheese industry, as consumers fail to purchase cheeses with this quality defect. This research investigates the effects of the protein concentration of cheese milk and the pH of cheese on the occurrence of CLC. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to determine total and soluble calcium concentrations in skim milk (SM1, 8.7% total solids), and skim milk supplemented with nonfat dry milk (CSM1, 13.5% total solids). Calcium, phosphorus, lactic acid, and citrate were determined in cheeses made with skim milk (SM2, 3.14% protein), skim milk supplemented with ultrafiltered milk (CSM2, 6.80% protein), and nonfat dry milk (CSM3, 6.80% protein). Supplementation with nonfat dry milk increased the initial total calcium in CSM1 (210 mg/100 g of milk) by 52% compared with the total calcium in SM1 (138 mg/100 g of milk). At pH 5.4, soluble calcium concentrations in CSM1 were 68% greater than soluble calcium in SM1. In cheeses made from CSM2 and CSM3, total calcium was 26% greater than in cheeses made from SM2. As the pH of cheeses made from SM2 decreased from 5.4 to 5.1, the concentration of soluble calcium increased by 61.6%. In cheeses made from CSM2 and CSM3, the concentrations of soluble calcium increased by 41.4 and 45.5%, respectively. Calcium lactate crystals were observed in cheeses made from SM2 at and below pH 5.1, whereas CLC were observed in cheeses from CSM2 and CSM3 at and below pH 5.3. The increased presence of soluble calcium can potentially cause CLC to occur in cheese manufactured with increased concentrations of milk solids, particularly at and below pH 5.1.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D002118', 'D017610', 'D002611', 'D019343', 'D003460', 'D006863', 'D007773', 'D019344', 'D007785', 'D008892', 'D008894', 'D010758', 'D013054']","['Animals', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Compounds', 'Cheese', 'Citric Acid', 'Crystallization', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lactates', 'Lactic Acid', 'Lactose', 'Milk', 'Milk Proteins', 'Phosphorus', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic']","Cheese pH, protein concentration, and formation of calcium lactate crystals.","[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None]","[None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17033000,2008,0

Twelve male pigs at 27.1 +/- 0.7 kg BW fitted with jugular venous cannulae were maintained in individual metabolic crates. The animals were each given one of three dietary treatments in random order: blackcurrant powder (BC) to give a dose of 100 mg total ACNs/kg BW mixed either with water and sugar (Diet A), cereal (Weet-Bix), milk, and sugar (Diet B), or cereal, milk, sugar, and an additional flavonol (rutin, approximately 100 mg/kg BW) (Diet C). The four major anthocyanins of BC, delphinidin-3-glucoside, delphinidin-3-rutinoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-rutinoside, were identified and quantified by HPLC-PDA in all three diets. In the pig plasma, four peaks with a reversed pattern to those of anthocyanins in the BC extract were detected. The total amount of anthocyanins absorbed was not significantly different between the three diets, but the rate of absorption and subsequent decline was slower following administration of diet B and C than diet A. All three diets increased antioxidant capacity when measured by the FRAP assay but not when measured by the ORAC and non-protein ORAC assay. However, the increase was delayed and did not appear until 4 h after ingestion, at a time when plasma anthocyanin levels had returned to baseline. The present study demonstrates that the simultaneous intake of food or other flavonoids delays the absorption profile for anthocyanins.

The limit of detection was of 0.65 fmol (0.14 pg) injected or 65 pM. Heterocyclic aromatic amines are mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds formed at low levels in protein-rich food during cooking. Due to the low concentrations and the high complexity of the matrix in which they exist (food, blood, and urine), and the often small sample volumes (capillary blood; urine, blood and milk from small animals), very sensitive and selective analytical methods are required for their detection. Miniaturization was accomplished by micro solid-phase extraction in capillaries with blue chitin as solid-phase, coupled on-line (in-capillary) to capillary electrophoresis with nanospray tandem mass spectrometric detection. This new technique provided a total analysis time of only 15 min, including extraction and separation, together with low sample and solvent consumption.

The goals of this study were to determine the current levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Japanese women, with analysis of the effects of lifestyle and dietary habits on these levels, and to develop a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) with which to predict the ratio of serum concentration to breast milk concentration. We measured PBDEs and PCBs in 89 paired samples of serum and breast milk collected in four regions of Japan in 2005. The geometric means of the total concentrations of PBDE (13 congeners) in milk and serum were 1.56 and 2.89 ng/g lipid, respectively, whereas those of total PCBs (15 congeners) were 63.9 and 37.5 ng/g lipid, respectively. The major determinant of total PBDE concentration in serum and milk was the geographic area within Japan, whereas nursing duration was the major determinant of PCB concentration. BDE-209 was the most predominant PBDE congener in serum but not in milk. The excretion of BDE 209 in milk was lower than that of BDE 47 and BDE 153. QSAR analysis revealed that two parameters, calculated octanol/water partition and number of hydrogen-bond acceptors, were significant descriptors. During the first weeks of lactation, the predicted partitioning of PBDE and PCB congeners from serum to milk agreed with the observed values.

This glycosidic enzyme is present in tears, saliva, nasal secretions, and milk--sources not amendable for commercial development. Recently, a high expression level of recombinant human lysozyme (0.5% dry weight) was achieved in transgenic rice seed. This paper evaluates the effects of pH and ionic strength on rice protein and lysozyme extractability, as well as their interactions with the strong cation-exchange resin, SP-Sepharose FF. The extraction conditions that maximized lysozyme yield and the ratio of extracted human lysozyme to native rice protein were not optimal for lysozyme adsorption. The conditions that gave the highest extracted lysozyme to native protein ratio were pH 4.5 and 100 mM NaCl in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer. At pH 4.5, salt concentrations above 100 mM NaCl reduced the lysozyme-to-protein ratio. The best conditions for lysozyme adsorption were pH 4.5 and 50 mM sodium acetate buffer. Lysozyme extraction and subsequent adsorption at pH 4.5 and 50 mM NaCl was an acceptable compromise between lysozyme extractability, adsorption, and purity. The primary recovery of human lysozyme from pH 6 extracts, irrespective of ionic strength, was inferior to that using pH 4.5 with unacceptably low saturation capacities and lysozyme purity. High purity was achieved with a single chromatography step by adjusting the pH 4.5 extract to pH 6 before adsorption.

This study examined if HAMLET-like complexes are present in casein from different species and if isolated alpha-lactalbumin from those species can form such complexes with oleic acid. Casein from human, bovine, equine, and porcine milk was separated by ion exchange chromatography and active complexes were only found in human casein. This was not explained by alpha-lactalbumin sequence variation, as purified bovine, equine, porcine, and caprine alpha-lactalbumins formed complexes with oleic acid with biological activity similar to HAMLET.

16675592,"Silibinin, a flavonolignan from milk thistle, has intestinal cancer chemopreventive efficacy in rodents. It is a strong antioxidant and modulates the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system by increasing circulating levels of IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) and decreasing levels of IGF-I. Here, the hypothesis was tested that administration of oral silibinin generates agent levels in human blood and colorectal and hepatic tissues consistent with pharmacologic activity. Patients with confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma received silibinin formulated with phosphatidylcholine (silipide) at dosages of 360, 720, or 1,440 mg silibinin daily for 7 days. Blood and biopsy samples of normal and malignant colorectum or liver were obtained before dosing, and blood and colorectal or hepatic tissues were collected at resection surgery after the final silipide dose. Levels of silibinin were quantified by high-pressure liquid chromatography-UV, and plasma metabolites were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Blood levels of IGFBP-3, IGF-I, and the oxidative DNA damage pyrimidopurinone adduct of deoxyguanosine (M1dG) were determined. Repeated administration of silipide was safe and achieved levels of silibinin of 0.3 to 4 micromol/L in the plasma, 0.3 to 2.5 nmol/g tissue in the liver, and 20 to 141 nmol/g tissue in colorectal tissue. Silibinin monoglucuronide, silibinin diglucuronide, silibinin monosulfate, and silibinin glucuronide sulfate were identified in the plasma. Intervention with silipide did not affect circulating levels of IGFBP-3, IGF-I, or M1dG.

The limit of detection and the limit of quantification were 250 ng/L for AFM(1). All the positive milk samples for AFM(1) were confirmed by LC-MS. AFM(1) was detected in 81% of milk samples, ranging from 2 to 108 ng/L. Three samples were over the legal limits (50 ng/L).

Furthermore, samples collected in the period September-October showed higher contamination than samples collected during the other months (42.68 vs. 10.55 ng/L). Both differences are related to the administration of compound feed. Based on current toxicological knowledge we concluded that the AFM(1) contamination levels recorded in ewe milk did not present a serious human health hazard.

16512259,"Nonvitamin micronutrients encompass innumerable nutritionally active substances present in foods at low levels that may have beneficial and protective properties. These include nonvitamin carotenoids, essential fatty acids, amino acids, phospholipid components, and conditionally essential components such as carnitine, choline, inositol, and any compounds with antioxidant, growth promoting, antimicrobial, or immune potential. These analytes are grossly underrepresented in the Official Methods of Analysis (OMA). The General Referee urges that the nonvitamin micronutrients, carnitine, inositol, and nucleotides need to be strategically targeted for collaborative study because they are not covered in OMA by any technique. Carnitine is available through limited de novo synthesis, although deficiency is recognized, particularly in infants. Thus, infant formulas are commonly supplemented with carnitine, and reliable analytical techniques are needed. A published enzymatic methodology will hopefully be subjected to collaborative study in the near future. Similarly, inositol is considered a conditionally essential pseudovitamin and although microbiological, gas and liquid chromatographic techniques are generally used, these approaches have not been subjected to the highest level of validation. Nucleotides play important roles in major biochemical functions, and recent evidence suggests that dietary nucleotides are semiessential for newborns. The nucleotides and nucleosides are present in human milk at relatively high levels, so bovine milk-based infant formulas are increasingly supplemented with the 5'monophosphate nucleotides, and it is unfortunate that no current AOAC method exists for quantification of nucleotides. Colostral immunoglobulins, specifically IgG, confer passive immunity to the neonate until the immune system is developed. There has been an increase in the global availability of colostrum-based functional foods and supplements, which are claimed to improve gastrointestinal health and stimulate the immune system. In the absence of a reference analytical method, it is becoming increasingly important to standardize analysis techniques for IgG in such materials. Although commercial radial immunodiffusion (RID) kits are available, they are generally variable in response. An affinity high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method based on specific binding of bovine IgG with immobilized Protein G has been validated within the laboratory of the prospective Study Director Don Otter and is currently at the protocol development stage. Biosensor technology can provide an alternative approach to IgG analysis, and an antibody-based optical method is also slated for collaborative study under Study Director Leyton Gapper. Where other organizations involved with method validation are active in these analyte areas, it may be timely to consider AOAC policy regarding joint adoption in order to avoid duplication of scarce scientific resources. Major difficulties may occur when validation protocols do not entirely meet the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, ISO 5725, and IUPAC harmonized protocols. Whether such studies need either to be repeated in full using OMA protocol, or perhaps, preferably, publish the method within OMA at a lower level of validation, requires clarification at the Official Methods Board level.",Journal of AOAC International,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D002623', 'D002851', 'D005504', 'D007136', 'D041943', 'D018977', 'D008892', 'D009711']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Chemistry Techniques, Analytical', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food Analysis', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Infant Formula', 'Micronutrients', 'Milk', 'Nucleotides']",Nonvitamin micronutrients.,"[None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000378', 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'methods', None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'metabolism', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16512259,2006,0

Results show that 16% of the conventionally produced samples and 32% of the organically produced samples had quantifiable levels of perchlorate using ion chromatography. Estimated perchlorate exposure from organically produced leafy vegetables was approximately 2 times that of conventional produce, but generally less than 10% of the reference dose recommended by the National Academy of Sciences. Furthermore, the iodide uptake inhibition potential of perchlorate was less than 1% of that of the nitrate present.

16428640,"Based on the potential benefits of cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) for human health, there is a need to develop effective strategies for enhancing milk fat CLA concentrations. Levels of cis-9, trans-11 CLA in milk can be increased by supplements of fish oil (FO) and sunflower oil (SO), but there is considerable variation in the response. Part of this variance may reflect time-dependent ruminal adaptations to high levels of lipid in the diet, which lead to alterations in the formation of specific biohydrogenation intermediates. To test this hypothesis, 16 late lactation Holstein-British Friesian cows were used in a repeated measures randomized block design to examine milk fatty acid composition responses to FO and SO in the diet over a 28-d period. Cows were allocated at random to corn silage-based rations (8 per treatment) containing 0 (control) or 45 g of oil supplement/kg of dry matter consisting (1:2; wt/wt) of FO and SO (FSO), and milk composition was determined on alternate days from d 1. Compared with the control, the FSO diet decreased mean dry matter intake (21.1 vs. 17.9 kg/d), milk fat (47.7 vs. 32.6 g/kg), and protein content (36.1 vs. 33.3 g/kg), but had no effect on milk yield (27.1 vs. 26.4 kg/d). Reductions in milk fat content relative to the FSO diet were associated with increases in milk trans-10 18:1, trans-10, cis-12 CLA, and trans-9, cis-11 CLA concentrations (r(2) = 0.74, 0.57, and 0.80, respectively). Compared with the control, the FSO diet reduced milk 4:0 to 18:0 and cis 18:1 content and increased trans 18:1, trans 18:2, cis-9, trans-11 CLA, 20:5 n-3, and 22:6 n-3 concentrations. The FSO diet caused a rapid elevation in milk cis-9, trans-11 CLA content, reaching a maximum of 5.37 g/100 g of fatty acids on d 5, but these increases were transient, declining to 2.35 g/100 g of fatty acids by d 15. They remained relatively constant thereafter. Even though concentrations of trans-11 18:1 followed the same pattern of temporal changes as cis-9, trans-11 CLA, the total trans 18:1 content of FSO milk was unchanged because of the concomitant increases in the concentration of other isomers (Delta(4-10) and Delta(12-15)), predominantely trans-10 18:1. In conclusion, supplementing diets with FSO enhances milk fat cis-9, trans-11 CLA content, but the high level of enrichment declines because of changes in ruminal biohydrogenation that result in trans-10 replacing trans-11 as the major 18:1 biohydrogenation intermediate formed in the rumen.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000824', 'D000818', 'D002417', 'D004032', 'D005223', 'D005227', 'D005260', 'D005395', 'D008401', 'D006865', 'D044243', 'D008892', 'D008894', 'D010938', 'D012417', 'D012820', 'D000074242', 'D003313']","['Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Diet', 'Fats', 'Fatty Acids', 'Female', 'Fish Oils', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Hydrogenation', 'Linoleic Acids, Conjugated', 'Milk', 'Milk Proteins', 'Plant Oils', 'Rumen', 'Silage', 'Sunflower Oil', 'Zea mays']",Examination of the persistency of milk fatty acid composition responses to fish oil and sunflower oil in the diet of dairy cows.,"[None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000008', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000008', 'Q000378', None, None, None]","[None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'administration & dosage', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'administration & dosage', 'metabolism', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16428640,2006,0

Soil (500 g/day) fortified with fluorene (104 microg/g dry soil), phenanthrene (82 microg/g), pyrene (78 microg/g), and benzo[a]pyrene (33 microg/g) was administered to three dairy cows via a rumen cannulas for 28 consecutive days. Parent compounds and their major metabolites in milk were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Secretion of parent compounds in milk did not increase significantly (P > 0.05) over the control values measured before supply. Target monohydroxylated metabolites were not detected in control samples, but 2-hydroxy fluorene, 3-hydroxy phenanthrene, and 1-hydroxy pyrene were present in milk by the second day of dosing. The highest concentrations of metabolites in milk (31-39 ng/mL) were for 1-hydroxy pyrene at days 7 and 14 of dosing. The observed plateaus for 3-hydroxy phenanthrene and 2-hydroxy fluorene were lower (respectively, 0.69 and 2.79 ng/mL) but significantly increased in comparison to the control samples. Contrarily, 3-hydroxy benzo[a]pyrene was not detected in milk at any sampling time. These results suggested a notable metabolism of the parent compounds after their extraction from soil during the digestive transfer. Thus, the metabolization of fluorene and pyrene can lead to higher concentrations of metabolites than of parent compounds in milk.

The present work is the first demonstration of its interaction with a mammalian protein. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was used to reveal and analyze the binding of piperine to a lipocalin protein. Induced CD spectra measured in pH 7.7 phosphate buffer at 37 degrees C demonstrated reversible, non-covalent association of piperine with bovine beta-lactoglobulin (BLG), the major whey protein in milk. The binding parameters (K(a) approximately 8 x 10(4) M(-1), n = 0.8) determined from the CD titration data showed no significant differences between the piperine binding properties of the two main genetic variants of BLG (A and B). The vanishing extrinsic CD signal obtained upon acidification of the piperine-BLG sample solution (Tanford transition) suggested that the ligand binds in the central hydrophobic cavity of the beta-barrel. The cavity binding concept was further supported by a CD displacement experiment using palmitic acid, the well-known hydrophobic ligand of BLG. Molecular docking calculations showed that piperine can be efficiently accommodated within the calyx of BLG. Additional molecular modeling calculations indicated that the beta-barrel of human tear lipocalin, human serum retinol binding protein, and human neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin might also accommodate a piperine molecule.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000470', 'D000818', 'D052117', 'D002417', 'D002942', 'D006863', 'D007782', 'D008958', 'D010880', 'D053284', 'D011485', 'D012044', 'D013056', 'D014961']","['Alkaloids', 'Animals', 'Benzodioxoles', 'Cattle', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lactoglobulins', 'Models, Molecular', 'Piperidines', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides', 'Protein Binding', 'Regression Analysis', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",Binding of the pepper alkaloid piperine to bovine beta-lactoglobulin: circular dichroism spectroscopy and molecular modeling study.,"['Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None]","['chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16366712,2006,0

Trace elements play a key role in the biomedical activities associated with royal jelly, as these elements have a multitude of known and unknown biological functions. For this reason concentrations of 28 trace (Al, Ba, Sr, Bi, Cd, Hg, Pb, Sn, Te, Tl, W, Sb, Cr, Ni, Ti, V, Co, Mo) and mineral (P, S, Ca, Mg, K, Na, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn) elements were systematically investigated in botanically and geologically defined royal jelly samples. In addition, concentrations of 14 trace elements were measured in the associated honey samples--honey being the precursor of royal jelly. Concentrations of K, Na, Mg, Ca, P, S, Cu, Fe, Zn, Al, Ba and Sr in royal jelly were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), while concentrations of Bi, Cd, Hg, Pb, Sn, Te, Tl, W, Sb, Cr, Mn, Ni, Ti, V, Co and Mo in royal jelly were determined by double focusing magnetic sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS). In the honey samples, trace and mineral element concentrations strongly depended on botanical and geological origin, and substantial variation was found. In contrast, the concentrations of trace and mineral elements were highly constant in the associated royal jelly samples. The most important results were the homeostatic adjustments of trace and mineral element concentrations in royal jelly. This effect was evidently produced in the endocrine glands of nurse bees, which are adapted for needs of bee larvae.

Monitoring potential perchlorate contamination in the environment is of interest, however, very few analytical methods have been developed for perchlorate determination in biological samples. Analysis of complex samples by ion chromatography is complicated by matrix components that can interfere with perchlorate determination. However, a recently developed preconcentration/preelution (PC/PE) ion chromatography method has demonstrated the capability to analyze certain complex samples such as high salinity water, milk, and hydroponic fertilizers. The ability of this method to reduce sample background and lower detection limits in ion chromatography for various biological samples was evaluated in this study. The PC/PE method was applicable to the analysis of kidneys, livers, zebrafish, quail eggs, lettuce, and urine. Optimal operating conditions were determined for each matrix. Ranges of optimal wash volumes were shorter when 15 mM NaOH prewash solutions were used compared with 10mM and good recovery was achieved for most matrices with an injection period > or =60s. Prewash solution concentration did not appear to significantly affect matrix background. The PC/PE method was capable of reducing sample background when compared to EPA Method 314.0, which resulted in detection limits, with the exception of zebrafish and urine, that were two-fold lower than those achieved with EPA Method 314.0.",Journal of chromatography.

The pressure-treated samples showed a time-dependent loss of native whey proteins by SEC and 1D PAGE and a corresponding increase in non-native proteins and protein aggregates of different sizes. These aggregates altered the viscosity and opacity of the samples and were shown to be cross-linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds and by noncovalent interactions using 1D PAGE [alkaline (or native), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and SDS of reduced samples (SDS(R))] and 2D PAGE (native:SDS and SDS:SDS(R)). The sensitivity of the major whey proteins to pressure was in the order beta-lactoglobulin B (beta-LG B) > beta-LG A > bovine serum albumin (BSA) > alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA), and the large internal hydrophobic cavity of beta-LG may have been partially responsible for its sensitivity to high-pressure treatments. It seemed likely that, at 800 MPa, the formation of a beta-LG disulfide-bonded network preceded the formation of disulfide bonds between alpha-LA or BSA and beta-LG to form multiprotein aggregates, possibly because the disulfide bonds of alpha-LA and BSA are less exposed than those of beta-LG either during or after pressure treatment.

All exclusively breastfed infants had a dual enrichment in carbon ( approximately 1 per thousand) and nitrogen ( approximately 2-3 per thousand) when compared to maternal values. In contrast, breast- and formula-fed subjects had reduced enrichments compared to exclusively breastfed subjects, and the exclusively formula-fed infant showed no increase in delta(13)C or delta(15)N values. This finding of a carbon trophic level effect in breastfeeding infants suggests that (13)C-enrichments of approximately 1 per thousand in archaeological populations are not necessarily the result of the consumption of C(4)-based weaning foods such as maize or millet. During the weaning process, the delta(13)C results for breastfed infants declined to maternal levels more rapidly than the delta(15)N results. This suggests that delta(13)C values have the potential to track the introduction of solid foods into the diet, whereas delta(15)N values monitor the length of time of breast milk consumption.

The acidolysis reactions were performed by incubating 1:1.5:0.5, 1:3:0.75, 1:6:1, 1:9:1.25, and 1:12:1.5 substrate molar ratios of tripalmitin/hazelnut oil fatty acids/stearic acid in 3 mL of n-hexane at 55, 60, and 65 degrees C using 10% (total weight of substrates) of Lipozyme RM IM for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. The fatty acid composition of reaction products was analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). The fatty acids at the sn-2 position were identified after pancreatic lipase hydrolysis and GLC analysis. The results showed that the highest C18:1 incorporation (47.1%) and highest C18:1/C16:0 ratio were obtained at 65 degrees C and 24 h of incubation with the highest substrate molar ratio of 1:12:1.5. The highest incorporation of stearic acid was achieved at a 1:3:0.75 substrate molar ratio at 60 degrees C and 24 h. For both oleic and stearic acids, the incorporation level increased with reaction time.

The presence of a micellar system avoids the previous steps of solvent extraction and reduces the cost, toxicity while enhancing the sensitivity, selectivity and the molar absorptivity. The reaction is instantaneous and the absorbance remains stable for over 24 h. The average molar absorption coefficient and Sandell's sensitivity were found to be 5.02 x 10(4) L mol(-1) cm(-1) and 10 ng cm(-2) of Hg, respectively. Linear calibration graphs were obtained for 0.05 - 10 mg L(-1) of Hg; the stoichiometric composition of the chelate is 1:2 (Hg:dithizone). The method is characterized by a detection limit of 1 microg L(-1) of Hg. Large excesses of over 60 cations, anions and complexing agents (e.g. EDTA, tartrate, oxalate, citrate, phosphate, thiourea, azide, SCN-) do not interfere in the determination. The method was successfully applied to a number of environmental water samples (potable and polluted), biological samples (human blood and urine; milk and fish) and soils; solutions contained both mercury(I) and mercury(II) as well as complex synthetic mixtures.

Therefore, no ADI has been established, and colchicine has been included in Annex IV of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2377/90. No abuse of this drug in intensive livestock farming has yet been reported. However, there may be a natural route of entry for this compound into the food chain when Colchicum autumnale is consumed by animals kept outdoors. To address this concern, we developed and validated a highly sensitive and selective quantitative LC-ESI-MS-MS method for the detection of colchicine in sheep serum and milk. For sample pretreatment, all samples were liquid-liquid extracted with phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and dichloromethane. LC separation was carried out on an RP C18 column employing a 0.5% formic acid/acetonitrile gradient system. The recoveries in both matrixes at a concentration range from 0.0005 to 1 mg/L were >80% with RSDs of <10%.

Furthermore, the acrylamide intake from these products by children up to one year of age has been estimated. Other kind of foods e.g. biscuits, are not included. Because of the expected low concentrations of acrylamide, a new sample extraction method for detection by liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry, was developed and validated. The lower limit of quantification was 0.5 microg kg(-1) for liquid samples and 2 microg kg(-1) for other samples. The average levels found for gruel, porridge and canned baby food, all ready to eat, were 1.4, 26, and 7.8 microg/kg respectively. We found great variations in the acrylamide levels between and in different food categories, <0.5-64 microg/kg. For all breast milk samples except one the acrylamide level was below the limit of quantification (0.5 microg/kg). In three out of eight analysed samples of breast milk substitute, the acrylamide content was verified and possible to quantify. Assuming an acrylamide level of 0.25 microg/kg in breast milk, the mean acrylamide intake during the first six months for children who were exclusively breast-fed was estimated to be 0.04 microg/kg b.w./day. The mean acrylamide intake from breast milk and commercially made baby food during the whole first year varies due to the length of breast-feeding and the choice of baby food.

The difference becomes progressively smaller as the calcium concentration increases. Denaturation of HAMLET was found to be irreversible. Samples of HAMLET that have been renatured after denaturation have lost the specific biological activity toward tumor cells. Three lines of evidence indicate that HAMLET is a kinetic trap: (1) It has lower stability than alpha-lactalbumin, although it is a complex of alpha-lactalbumin and oleic acid; (2) its denaturation is irreversible and HAMLET is lost after denaturation; (3) formation of HAMLET requires a specific conversion protocol.",Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,"['D000645', 'D000818', 'D001059', 'D017209', 'D002118', 'D002152', 'D002417', 'D002470', 'D002621', 'D002852', 'D002942', 'D004587', 'D006358', 'D006801', 'D007700', 'D007768', 'D009682', 'D008892', 'D008894', 'D008956', 'D019301', 'D011485', 'D011487', 'D011489', 'D017510', 'D040901', 'D013050', 'D013696', 'D013816', 'D014466', 'D014508']","['Ammonium Sulfate', 'Animals', 'Apoproteins', 'Apoptosis', 'Calcium', 'Calorimetry, Differential Scanning', 'Cattle', 'Cell Survival', 'Chemistry', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lactalbumin', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Milk', 'Milk Proteins', 'Models, Chemical', 'Oleic Acid', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Protein Folding', 'Proteomics', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Temperature', 'Thermodynamics', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Urea']",Stability of HAMLET--a kinetically trapped alpha-lactalbumin oleic acid complex.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, None, None, 'Q000494']","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'methods', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, 'methods', None, None, None, None, 'pharmacology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15659367,2005,0

In addition, six cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage fragments were prepared. Limited hydrolysis, oxidized and reduced/alkylated derivatives were also produced. The preparations were purified by ion exchange, gel filtration chromatography, reversed phase and high-performance liquid chromatography. The homogeneity was visualized by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and poly acryl amide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by IgE and IgG immunoblotting. IgE binding was measured by Biotin Streptavidin (Bio/strep) fluoro enzyme immuno assay (FEIA) or ELISA-inhibition. Eighteen CM allergy (CMA) sera from 45 clinically examined children (Melbourne) and five adults (Bergen) were selected. Individual sera and pools were used for mapping IgE-binding epitopes. Rabbit IgG sera and pools were used for locating the antigenic sites of the molecule. Results indicated that all the individual CMA sera and pools recognized the intact molecule and three of the CNBr fragments as major antibody-binding allergens. The N- and C-terminal peptides (CAS 16-35; CAS 136-155) showed high IgE-binding affinity. CAS 1-18 and CAS 181-199 showed high IgG bindings. Considering the diversity of the antibody specificities, a reasonable agreement between IgE and IgG epitopes were found at the N- and C-terminals of CAS1_BOVIN. Mapping IgE B-cell epitopes by direct Bio/strep FEIA allowed the development of a sensitive modified technique for detecting unlabelled, casein immune dominant peptides in food products.",Scandinavian journal of immunology,"['D000485', 'D000818', 'D000941', 'D001402', 'D002364', 'D002417', 'D002851', 'D004797', 'D018985', 'D005260', 'D007074', 'D010446', 'D011817']","['Allergens', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Caseins', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte', 'Female', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Rabbits']",Evaluation of the allergenicity and antigenicity of bovine-milk alphas1-casein using extensively purified synthetic peptides.,"['Q000276', None, 'Q000276', 'Q000276', 'Q000276', None, None, None, 'Q000276', None, 'Q000097', 'Q000138', None]","['immunology', None, 'immunology', 'immunology', 'immunology', None, None, None, 'immunology', None, 'blood', 'chemical synthesis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15541041,2004,0

First, in vitro spiking of goat plasma was performed with ivermectin, moxidectin, abamectin, doramectin, or eprinomectin. In parallel, goats were treated with subcutaneous injection of ivermectin. Then, cow, sheep, rabbit, pig, and human plasma were spiked with moxidectin. Four fractions were separated using KBr density gradient ultracentrifugation: very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and lipoprotein-deficient fraction. Cholesterol was analyzed by enzymatic assay and MLs by high-performance liquid chromatography. An average of 96% of MLs was associated with lipoproteins. The five MLs studied distributed similarly into goat plasma fractions with a preferential association with HDL (80-90%). Ivermectin partitioning in goat plasma was similar after in vitro spiking and in vivo treatment. In species displaying various lipoprotein profiles, moxidectin was also mainly associated with HDL. However, in human plasma, moxidectin was associated with a lesser extent to HDL (70%) and more to LDL (22%) when compared to other animal species. A relation between the plasma cholesterol content and pharmacokinetics of the drug is suggested.

An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) protocol was developed for the quantification of beta-LG f(142-148) in whey protein hydrolysates and in human blood serum. The minimum detection limit was 3 ng/mL. The level of the peptide in whey protein hydrolysates was influenced by the degree of hydrolysis (DH). As expected, highest levels of this peptide were found in hydrolysates generated with trypsin. Sequential incubation of hydrolysates at different DH values with pepsin and Corolase PP, to simulate gastrointestinal digestion, generally resulted in the degradation of beta-LG f(142-148) as determined by EIA. Reversed-phase HPLC and angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity assays demonstrated that synthetic beta-LG f(142-148) was rapidly degraded upon incubation with human serum. Furthermore, beta-LG f(142-148) could not be detected by EIA in the sera of 2 human volunteers following its oral ingestion or in sera from these volunteers subsequently spiked with beta-LG f(142-148). These in vitro results indicate that beta-LG f(142-148) is probably not sufficiently stable to gastrointestinal and serum proteinases and peptidases to act as an hypotensive agent in humans following oral ingestion.

Skimmed pony mare's milk was fractionated by either reversed phase-high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on a C4 column or a bi-dimensional separation technique coupling RP-HPLC in the first dimension and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in the second dimension (two-dimensional RP-HPLC/SDS-PAGE). The fractions thus obtained were analyzed by Edman N-terminal microsequencing and mass determination, with or without tryptic digestion, on a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight spectrometer. Based on the sequence and molecular mass information obtained, identifications were achieved through a protein database search using homology or pattern research algorithms. This methodological approach was shown to be rapid, efficient and reliable in identifying the principal proteins in pony mare's milk. kappa-, alpha(s1)-, alpha(s2)-, and beta-casein, lysozyme C, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin I and II were thus identified. alpha(s1) and beta-caseins displayed polymorphic patterns, probably due to alternative splicing processes leading to casual exon skipping events involving exons 7 and 14 in alpha(s1)-casein and exon 5 in beta-casein. Edman N-terminal microsequencing over 35 amino acid residues, for pony alpha(s1)-casein, clearly demonstrated the occurrence, in Equidae, of a splicing pattern similar to that reported in rodents, characterized by the constitutive outsplicing of exon 5. Pony mare's milk SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC patterns were compared with those obtained for other milks (cow, goat and human), as were the relative levels of caseins and major whey proteins in these milks.

Higher concentrations, and subsequently higher ranges, of Cd, Cu and As were recorded in individuals living near the mine (MSD group), in opposition to individuals living several kilometers apart. Additionally, the concentrations recorded in the hair of some individuals from the MSD group were above the reference values for non-exposed individuals, suggesting their enhanced exposure. However, no significant differences were found for the average concentration of these elements between villages. Individuals from the CP and SC groups presented significantly higher concentrations of Zn and Mn in scalp hair.

15159247,"The chemistry of conjugated fatty acids, specifically octadecadienoic acids (18:2; commonly referred to as conjugated linoleic acid, or CLA), has provided many challenges to lipid analysts because of their unique physical properties and the many possible positional and geometric isomers. After the acid-labile properties of CLAs during analytic procedures were overcome, it became evident that natural products, specifically dairy fats, contain one dominant (c9,t11-CLA), 3 intermediate (t7,c9-, t9,c11-, and t11,c13-CLA), and up to 20 more minor CLA isomers. The best analytic techniques to date include a combination of gas chromatography that uses 100-m highly polar capillary columns, silver ion-HPLC, and a combination of silver ion-thin-layer chromatography and gas chromatography to analyze the CLA and trans 18:1 isomers, because some of them serve as precursors of CLA in biological systems. These analytic techniques have assisted commercial suppliers to prepare pure CLA isomers and have permitted the evaluation of individual CLA isomers for their nutritional and biological activity in animal and human systems. It is increasingly evident that different CLA isomers have distinctly different physiologic and biochemical properties. These techniques are essential to evaluate dairy fats for their CLA content, to design experimental diets to increase the amount of CLA in dairy fats, and to determine the CLA profile in these CLA-enriched dairy fats.

To date, it has been difficult to determine whether these compounds are natural products or derived from industrial synthesis. Molecular-level 14C analysis of these compounds is particularly appealing because most industrial compounds are manufactured from petrochemicals (14C-free) and natural compounds should have ""modern"" or ""contemporary"" 14C levels. To investigate the source of DBP-Br4Cl2, we isolated 600 microg of this compound (150 microg of carbon) from marine animal extracts by employing gel permeation chromatography, Florisil column chromatography, and two-dimensional preparative capillary gas chromatography. The purified DBP-Br4Cl2 was split into two samples (75 microg of carbon each) and analyzed by accelerator mass spectrometry for 14C content. The delta14C values were -449 percent per thousand and -467 percent per thousand, corresponding to conventional 14C ages of 4740 and 5000 years before present (BP), respectively. The presence of detectable 14C in the DBP-Br4Cl2 strongly points to at least a natural or biogenic source.

The concentration of the H2B1a component of IVM was analysed in these dairy products using an HPLC method with fluorescence detection. The mean recovery of the method was, depending on the matrix, between 87 and 100%. Limits of detection in the order of only 0.1 microg H2B1a/kg of product were achieved. Maximum concentrations of IVM were detected mostly at 2 d after drug administration to the ewes. The highest concentration of IVM was found on day 2 in 60-day ripened cheese (96 microg H2B1a/kg cheese). Secondary whey was the matrix with the lowest concentration of IVM (<0.6 microg H2B1a/ kg). Residue levels fell below the limits of detection between day 5 (for secondary whey) and day 25 (for all cheese samples). In the matrices investigated, linear correlations between daily concentrations of IVM, milk fat and solid content were evident. During yoghurt production, fermentation and thermal stability of IVM was observed. During cheese production, approximately 35% of the IVM, present in the raw (bulk) milk samples, was lost. From the results it was concluded that the processing of ewes' milk did not eliminate the drug residues under investigation. The consequences of IVM in the human diet were discussed.

In subsequent experiments and using well-defined labeled as well as nonlabeled oligosaccharides, it was found that the fluorescent tag does not interfere with the binding and that the optimum epitope for the interaction with Con A comprises the tetramannoside unit Manalpha2Manalpha6(Manalpha3)Man[D(3)B(A)4'], rather than the generally accepted trimannoside Manalpha6 (Manalpha3)Man [B(A)4' or 4(4')3].

Milk products can be considered as a potential matrix for folate fortification, e.g., with synthetic folic acid, to enhance the daily intake of folate. In untreated milk, the natural folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH3-H4folate), is bound to folate-binding proteins (FBP). In this study, the extent of binding to FBP for folic acid and 5-CH3-H4folate was investigated in a dynamic in vitro model simulating human gastric passage. Protein binding of folic acid and 5-CH3-H4folate was characterized using gel-exclusion chromatography. Before gastric passage, folic acid and 5-CH3-H4folate were bound mainly to FBP (76-79%), whereas 7% was free. Folic acid remained bound to FBP to a similar extent after gastric passage. For 5-CH3-H4folate, the FBP-bound fraction gradually decreased from 79 to 5% and the free fraction increased from 7 to 93%. Although folic acid enters the proximal part of the intestine bound to FBP, 5-CH3-H4folate appears to be present mainly as free folate in the duodenal lumen. The stability of FBP was similar in both folate/FBP mixtures, i.e., 70% of the initial FBP content was retained after gastric passage. This study indicated that FBP are partly stable during gastric passage but have different binding characteristics for folic acid and 5-CH3-H4folate in the duodenal lumen.

14614589,"Ochratoxin A (OTA) can occur in a large variety of commodities (cereals, beans, groundnuts, spices, dried fruits, coffee, beer, wine) and, because of a carry-over effect, in milk, pig blood, liver, and kidney, and poultry meat from animals fed with contaminated feed. Because of the persistence of OTA in the food chain, exposure to the compound is a potential human health hazard. This has prompted adoption of regulatory limits in several countries which, in turn, implies the development of suitable validated and official analytical methods and rapid screening tests for cost-effective food control on a large scale. Liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FLD), coupled with immunoaffinity column (IAC) clean-up, is the most widely employed analytical technique. LC coupled with electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (MS) has detection limits comparable with those of LC-FLD and the selectivity of IAC can be achieved by tandem (MS-MS) or sequential (MS(n)) detection. Synthetic counterparts to natural antibodies in the form of molecularly imprinted polymers seem a promising alternative to IAC for sample preparation. New analytical approaches to rapid, low-cost screening methods, for example those based on biosensors and dip-stick-like kits, are a direction in which innovation can be expected.

Mean mercury concentrations in caps and stalks of the mushroom species examined and soils varied between 30+/-31 and 920+/-280, 17+/-11 and 560+/-220, and 10+/-9 and 170+/-110 ng/g dry matter, respectively. Cap to stalk mercury concentration quotients were from 1.0+/-0.4 in poison pax (Paxillus involutus) to 2.8+/-0.7 in slippery jack (Suillus luteus). Brown cort (Cortinarius malicorius), fly agaric (Amanita muscaria), orange-brown ringless amanita (A. fulva), red-aspen bolete (Leccinum rufum) and mutagen milk cap (Lactarius necator) contained the highest concentrations of mercury both in caps and stalks, and mean concentrations varied between 600+/-750 and 920+/-280 and 370+/-470 and 560+/-220 ng/g dry matter, respectively. An estimate of daily intake of mercury from mushroom consumption indicated that the flesh of edible species of mushrooms may not pose hazards to human health even at a maximum consumption rate of 28 g/day. However, it should be noted that mercury intake from other foods will augment the daily intake rates. Species such as the sickener (Russula emetica), Geranium-scented russula (R. fellea) and poison pax (P. involutus) did not concentrate mercury as evidenced from the bioconcentration factors (BCFs: concentrations in mushroom/concentration in soil substrate), which were less than 1.

14514717,"Human C1 inhibitor (hC1INH) is a therapeutic N, O-glycoprotein with a growing number of clinical applications, but the current natural supplies are not likely to meet the clinical demands. Therefore, recombinant approaches are of interest, whereby specific attention has to be paid to the generated glycosylation patterns. Here, the N,O-glycoprotein was expressed in the mammary gland of transgenic rabbits and subjected to glycan analysis. After release of the N-glycans of recombinant-rabbit human C1 inhibitor (rhC1INH) by peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase F, the oligosaccharides were separated from the O-glycoprotein by centrifugal filtration, then fractionated by a combination of anion-exchange, normal-phase, and high-pH anion-exchange liquid chromatography. The O-glycans, released from the O-glycoprotein by alkaline borohydride treatment, were fractionated by anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The structures of individual components were analysed by 500 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy, in most cases combined with MALDI-TOF MS. In contrast to the structural data reported for native serum hC1INH, rhC1INH contained a broad array of different N-glycans, made up of oligomannose-, hybrid-, and complex-type structures. In the case of complex-type N-glycans (partially) (alpha2-6)-sialylated (N-acetylneuraminic acid only), mono- and diantennary chains were found; part of the diantennary structures were (alpha1-6)-core-fucosylated or (alpha1-3)-fucosylated in the lower or upper antenna (Lewis x). The manno-oligosaccharide pattern of part of the hybrid- and oligomannose-type structures indicates that besides the usual N-glycan processing route, also the alternative endo-mannosidase pathway is followed.

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine alpha(S1)-casein (alpha(S1)-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and beta-CN f58-76; ovine alpha(S1)-CN f1-6 and alpha(S2)-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine beta-CN f58-65 and alpha(S2)-CN f182-187; buffalo beta-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human beta-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 micro g/ml (100 micro mol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 micro g/ml).

As shown already, the indolyl radical subsequently oxidizes a tyrosine side chain to the phenoxy radical in an intramolecular reaction. However this reaction is not total and its stoichiometry depends on the protein. Rate constants also vary between proteins, from 120 x s(-1) to 1000 x s(-1) at pH 7.0 and room temperature [extremes are hen and turkey egg white (120 x s(-1)) and human milk (1000 x s(-1))].

The subjects were asked to complete a 3-day food record and food frequency questionnaire to ascertain the nutrient content of their food intake and approximate eating habits. Hind milk was drawn manually by means of a fabricated glass breast pump and collected in polypropylene vials. The milk samples were stored in a freezer maintained at -25+/-2 degrees C until they were transported to the University of Montreal for fatty acid composition.

However, a purification procedure for authentic intact OPN as well as fragments of OPN from an accessible biological source is missing. A four-step procedure was used to purify OPN from human milk, based on its crystal growth inhibitory activity, including anion exchange chromatography, the elimination of casein, hydroxyapatite chromatography, and negative affinity chromatography. Purified OPN was further separated into its different molecular forms by means of a two-step procedure, involving size exclusion chromatography and reverse phase chromatography. A rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised to purified intact OPN and high M(r) OPN components; the immunoreactivity of both forms was almost equal when investigated by enzyme immunoassay (EIA).

12873991,"The kallikrein family is a group of 15 serine protease genes clustered on chromosome 19q13.4. Human kallikrein (hK) gene 5 (KLK5) is a member of this family and encodes for a secreted serine protease (hK5). KLK5 was shown to be differentially expressed at the mRNA level in breast and ovarian cancer. Until now, detection of hK5 protein in either biological fluids or tissues has not been described due to lack of suitable reagents and methods. The aim of this study was to develop immunological reagents and a sensitive and specific fluorometric immunoassay (ELISA) for hK5, to examine the presence of hK5 in human tissues and biological fluids, and to study the possible clinical utility of hK5 as a biomarker for endocrine-related malignancies. Recombinant hK5 protein was produced and purified using a Pichia pastoris yeast expression system. The protein was used as an immunogen to generate mouse and rabbit polyclonal anti-hK5 antibodies. A sandwich-type microplate immunoassay (ELISA) was developed using these antibodies, coupled with a time-resolved fluorometric detection technique. The ELISA assay was then used to measure hK5 in various biological fluids, tissue extracts, and serum samples from normal individuals and patients with various malignancies. The hK5 ELISA immunoassay has a lower detection limit of 0.1 micro g/liter, is specific for hK5, and has no cross-reactivity with other homologous kallikreins. The dynamic range is 0.1-25 micro g/liter, and within-run and between-run coefficients of variation within this range are <10%. hK5 is found in many tissues, with the highest expression levels seen in the skin, breast, salivary gland, and esophagus. hK5 is present at relatively high levels in milk of lactating women. Whereas the levels of hK5 are almost undetectable in serum of normal individuals (male and female) and patients with diverse malignancies, higher concentrations were found in a proportion of patients with ovarian (69%) and breast (49%) cancer. High levels were also detected in ascites fluid from metastatic ovarian cancer patients and in ovarian cancer tissue extracts. In conclusion, we report development of the first immunofluorometric assay for hK5 and describe the distribution of hK5 in biological fluids and tissue extracts. Our preliminary data indicate that hK5 is a potential biomarker in patients with ovarian and breast cancer.",Cancer research,"['D000328', 'D000595', 'D000818', 'D001202', 'D014408', 'D001943', 'D002417', 'D002850', 'D005260', 'D015200', 'D015870', 'D006801', 'D007610', 'D008297', 'D051379', 'D008892', 'D008969', 'D010051', 'D010053', 'D011817', 'D011994', 'D012680']","['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Female', 'Fluoroimmunoassay', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Kallikreins', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Milk', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Ovarian Neoplasms', 'Ovary', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",Human kallikrein 5: a potential novel serum biomarker for breast and ovarian cancer.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000201', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000201', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'enzymology', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'enzymology', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12873991,2003,0

A total of 108 samples, belonging to 11 food groups (vegetables, tubers, fruits, cereals, pulses, fish and shellfish, meat and meat products, eggs, milk, dairy products, and oils and fats), were analyzed by high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). The levels of tetra-, penta-, hexa-, and hepta-CNs, those of octachloronaphthalene, and the mean sum concentration of tetra-octa-CN were determined. The highest concentration of total PCNs was found in oils and fats (447 pg/g), followed by cereals (71 pg/g), fish and shellfish (39 pg/g), and dairy products (36 pg/g). In general, tetra-CN was the predominant homologue in all food groups except for fruits and pulses, which had greater proportions of hexa-CNs. The dietary intake of total PCNs was subsequently determined. For calculations, recent data on consumption of the selected food items were used. Intake of PCNs was estimated for five population groups of Catalonia: children, adolescents, male and female adults, and seniors. When the dietary intake of total PCNs was expressed in nanogram per kilogram of body weight per day, it was age-dependent, with the highest and lowest values corresponding to children (1.65) and seniors (0.54), respectively.

The influence of aluminium content in tap water in reconstituted powder formulae was examined and an estimate was made of the theoretical toxic aluminium intake in comparison with the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI). Possible interactions between aluminium and certain essential trace elements added to infant formulations have been studied according to the type or main protein-based infant formula. In general, the infant formulae contained a higher aluminium content than that found in human milk, especially in the case of soya, preterm or hydrolysed casein-based formulae. Standard formulae gave lower aluminium intakes amounting to about 4% PTWI. Specialized and preterm formulae resulted in a moderate intake (11-12 and 8-10% PTWI, respectively) and soya formulae contributed the highest intake (15% PTWI). Aluminium exposure from drinking water used for powder formula reconstitution was not considered a potential risk. In accordance with the present state of knowledge about aluminium toxicity, it seems prudent to call for continued efforts to standardize routine quality control and reduce aluminium levels in infant formula as well as to keep the aluminium concentration under 300 microg l(-1) for all infant formulae, most specifically those formulae for premature and low birth neonates.",Food additives and contaminants,"['D000535', 'D005504', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D007223', 'D007225', 'D007231', 'D008452', 'D008895', 'D011785', 'D013030', 'D013054', 'D014881']","['Aluminum', 'Food Analysis', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Food', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Maximum Allowable Concentration', 'Milk, Human', 'Quality Assurance, Health Care', 'Spain', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Water Supply']",Aluminium content of Spanish infant formula.,"['Q000008', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000032']","['administration & dosage', 'methods', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12775466,2003,0

This technique is useful for screening biological tissues that contain lipids for musk compounds. Analytes are desorbed from the sorbent trap sequentially with polar and nonpolar solvents, concentrated, and directly analyzed by high resolution gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer operating in the selected ion monitoring mode. In this paper, we analyzed two homogenized samples of whole fish tissues with spiked synthetic musk compounds using closed-loop stripping analysis and pressurized liquid extraction (PLE).

The half-lives determined in two male subjects were 2.2 and 7 h. Acrylamide was found in human breast milk and penetrated the human placenta (n = 3). The variability of acrylamide concentrations found in this investigation is most likely caused by variable intersubject bioavailability and metabolism. This may be an important indication that the assessment of the risk from acrylamide for the individual may be very difficult without knowing the concentrations of acrylamide in the body.

Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations were determined for 108 samples of vegetables, fruits, pulses, cereals, fish and shellfish, meats and meat products, eggs, milk and dairy products, and oils and fats. Levels of 11 PCB congeners (IUPAC 28, 52, 77, 101, 105, 118, 126, 138, 153, 169, and 180) were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. For toxic equivalent (TEQ) calculations, World Health Organization (WHO) toxicity equivalent factors (WHO-TEFs) were used. The highest levels of most congeners were found in fish and shellfish (11,864.18 ng/kg [wet weight]), and the next highest levels, which were substantially lower, were found in milk and dairy products (674.50 ng/kg [wet weight]). For the general population of Catalonia, the total dietary intake of PCBs was found to be 150.13 pg WHO-TEQ/day. The largest contribution to this intake came from fish and shellfish (82.87 pg WHO-TEQ/day) and dairy products (29.38 pg WHO-TEQ per day).

12613848,"Several lines of research support a role for human milk oligosaccharides in the defense of breast-fed infants against pathogens. Some ofthese oligosaccharides contain at least one moiety of sialic acid and are, thus, termed sialyloligosaccharides. These constitute a significant component (>1 g/L) of human milk. It is well established that milk composition varies among species, and previous reports have indicated that one ofthe differences between human and bovine milk is precisely their contents of sialyloligosaccharides. Because most infant formulas are manufactured with bovine milk components, it follows that formula-fed and breast-fed infants ingest dissimilar quantities of these carbohydrate structures. To ascertain these differences and their impact along lactation, the contents of oligosaccharide-bound sialic acids and major sialyloligosaccharides in samples of human and bovine milk (obtained at different lactation stages) were determined. In addition, infant formulas were assayed for their sialyloligosaccharide contents. Seven sialyloligosaccharides were identified in human milk; namely, 3'-sialyl-3-fucosyllactose and sialyllacto-N-tetraoses (a and b+c), the predominant structures at all lactation stages. Five sialyloligosaccharides were identified in bovine milk, of which 6'-sialyllactosamine and 3'-sialyllactose were the most abundant. In addition, sialyloligosaccharides in human and bovine milk decreased along lactation, and infant formulas did not contain significant amounts of sialyloligosaccharides. The results point to the general conclusion that regarding both qualitative and quantitative aspects, milk from humans and cows and infant formulas have different oligosaccharide contents. In this sense, bottle-fed infants are subject to reduced sialyloligosaccharide intake as compared to breast-fed infants.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000824', 'D000818', 'D000833', 'D002417', 'D002851', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D007223', 'D007225', 'D007227', 'D007231', 'D007774', 'D008892', 'D008895', 'D009439', 'D009844', 'D013045']","['Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Animals', 'Animals, Suckling', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Food', 'Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lactation', 'Milk', 'Milk, Human', 'Neuraminidase', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Species Specificity']",Sialyloligosaccharides in human and bovine milk and in infant formulas: variations with the progression of lactation.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12613848,2003,0
12612204,"Allergic disease (AD), including atopic eczema, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy, is characterized by an imbalance between cytokines produced by distinct T-helper cell subtypes. Whether this imbalance can be transferred from mother to breast milk remains to be established. The objective was to investigate the concentrations and interactions of nutritional and inflammatory factors in breast milk. Breast milk samples were collected from mothers with AD (n = 43) and without AD (n = 51). The concentrations of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-4, IL-10, prostaglandin E2, and cysteinyl leukotrienes were measured by immunoassays and fatty acid composition by gas chromatography. Mothers with AD had a lower concentration of TGF-beta2 in breast milk [median (interquartile range), 420 (278-701) ng/L] compared with those without AD [539 (378-1108) ng/L; p = 0.003], whereas other cytokines, prostaglandin E2, and cysteinyl leukotriene concentrations or fatty acid composition were not significantly different between the groups. The breast milk inflammatory factors and fatty acid composition were shown to be related. A positive association was observed between TGF-beta2 and the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (p = 0.038) and a negative association between TGF-beta2 and the proportion of saturated fatty acids (p = 0.029) in breast milk. The reduced TGF-beta2 concentration in the breast milk of mothers with AD may interfere with the development of the mucosal immune system of the breast-fed infant.

The established DQOs included the following: ACCURACY: Correct values were obtained for a suitable reference material, SRM 1846 Infant Formula [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, MD]. RUGGEDNESS: Variables were defined as (1) extraction time (35 min optimum); (2) ratio of sample size to diatomaceous earth support material (1 g sample/2 g support); (3) ratio of distilled water to alcohol (50% isopropanol optimum for both milk- and soy-based infant formula samples); (4) extraction flow rate was 3-3.5 mL/min optimum. PRECISION: Relative standard deviations of multiple determinations fell within the Horwitz limits of acceptability of < or = 2.8% at the level of analyte determined (0.34-2.5% obtained).

12602934,"Five plant-based weaning foods (WF) (Dietrend, Jot-M, Soy, Ang, and Vic-T) locally prepared in Jos, Nigeria were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and atomic emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma to determine their fatty acid (FA), amino acid, and trace mineral contents, respectively. Results of these direct analyses were compared to expected values derived from food composition tables prepared by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Additionally, results were compared against recommended nutrient values, using breast milk as the standard for FA content and recommended dietary allowances (RDA) for amino acid and mineral contents. The overall nutritional value of the five WF varied considerably and the quantities of particular nutrients determined by direct analysis differed markedly from those estimated using USDA food tables. Comparison of WF fatty acid composition relative to the RDA recommendations and a human milk standard revealed a much higher proportion of both linoleic (35-55 wt%) and alpha-linolenic acids (1%-7 wt%) relative to human milk lipids (11%-12% and 0.8%-0.9% wt, respectively); however, the WF were devoid of arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Soy contained the highest amounts of linoleic acid (59.7 mg/g) and alpha-linolenic acid (7.46 mg/g) compared to the other four WF (10.2-41.0 and 0.35-3.18 mg/g, respectively). The linoleic acid/alpha-linolenic acid ratio was within the recommended range (5:1 to 10:1) in only Jot-M (10:1) and Soy (8:1). Dietrend, Vic-T and Ang, contained linoleic/alpha-linolenic ratios of 12:1, 29:1, and 82:1, respectively. The Soy weaning food would provide the most protein (24.3 g/day), based on an estimated daily intake of 65 g of weaning food by a normal six-month-old infant, compared to Jot-M (11.9 g/day), Dietrend (11.7 g/day), Ang (8.07 g/day), and Vic-T (7.26 g/day). The protein RDA for children up to 1 year of age is 13-14 g/day. Comparison of the mineral contents of the WF to the RDAs for various minerals indicated that all five would provide suboptimal amounts of calcium (16 to 250 mg/day) and zinc (1.42 to 3.56 mg/day) compared to respective RDAs of 400 mg/day and 5 mg/day. These data show that the Soy weaning food is an excellent source of linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid, as well as being a good source of high quality protein. Jot-M and Dietrend provide useful amounts of the essential FA; however, it is advisable to reevaluate the composition of Ang and Vic-T to find ways to improve the linoleic/alpha-linolenic ratio of each and increase their total protein content.

Dairy GS were obtained from the Folch's upper (hydrophilic) and lower (lipophilic) extraction phases, respectively, and determined as lipid-bound sialic acid (LBSA) by colorimetry. Molar ratios of LBSA in the hydro- and lipophilic GS fractions were 52:48 to 79:21. Mature buffalo milk types had 40-100% more LBSA in the lipophilic GS fraction compared to SCM. Liquid PBC was higher in LBSA (24 nmol/g) compared to mature milk types (8-11 nmol/g). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and scanning densitometry showed distinct profiles of hydrophilic and lipophilic GS fractions. Lipophilic GS (but importantly not hydrophilic GS) from IBM and its serum decreased prostaglandin series 2 production by 75-80% in cultured human colonic epithelial cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). Hydrophilic GD(3) and lipophilic GM(3) selectively bound rotavirus particles prepared from a rhesus strain and its mutant. A GS fraction in IBM showed a GM(1)-specific binding to cholera toxin subunit B (CTB). IBM serum (IBMS) was a rich source of LBSA (420 nmol/g proteins). In summary, improved methodology led to increased LBSA recovery and isolation of additional and bioactive milk GS.

12566482,"Why breastfed infants absorb extrinsic iron (EFe) exceptionally well is an unexplained phenomenon. Our objective was to identify effects of human milk fractions (HMF) on bioavailability of EFe. HMF were prepared by centrifugation followed by successive ultrafiltration using 10-, 3- and 1-kDa molecular weight cutoff membranes. EFe was added to HMF before and after treatment with digestive enzymes. Solubilization of EFe by HMF was characterized by scintillation counting of radioiron and by size exclusion chromatography/inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SEC/ICPMS) of stable iron. Effects of HMF on EFe uptake and basolateral transfer were assessed by using confluent Caco-2 cells in bicameral chambers. Whey fractions of low molecular weight (MW) derived from 10-kDa filtrate, except the 1-kDa filtrate, were as effective as ascorbate and nitrilotriacetate in solubilizing EFe at intestinal pH. Basolateral radioiron transfer from Caco-2 cell monolayers was greater in the presence of low MW whey fractions than in the presence of ferrous ascorbate. The 3-kDa filtrate and 3-kDa retentate fractions promoted basolateral transfer of cellular radioiron taken up previously. SEC/ICPMS of the 1-kDa retentate fraction revealed a UV-absorbing peak of MW approximately 4.2 kDa that contained iron and that solubilized added ferric iron both before and after in vitro digestion with pepsin, pancreatin and bile extract. Our results suggested that a low MW component of breast milk whey enhances iron bioavailability. Because the iron solubilization activity is resistant to in vitro digestion, it is plausible that the component is active in vivo and may explain the excellent absorption of EFe by breastfed infants [corrected].",The Journal of nutrition,"['D000042', 'D001682', 'D018938', 'D006801', 'D007501', 'D008895']","['Absorption', 'Biological Availability', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Iron', 'Milk, Human']",Breast milk fractions solubilize Fe(III) and enhance iron flux across Caco-2 cells.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000493', 'Q000502']","[None, None, None, None, 'pharmacokinetics', 'physiology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12566482,2003,0

The most abundant carotenoid in tomato is lycopene, followed by phytoene, phytofluene, zeta-carotene, gamma-carotene, beta-carotene, neurosporene, and lutein. The distribution of lycopene and related carotenoids in tomatoes and tomato-based food products has been determined by extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography-UV/Visible photodiode array detection. Detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of human serum, milk, and organs, particularly prostate, have revealed the presence of all the aforementioned carotenoids in biologically significant concentrations. Two oxidative metabolites of lycopene, 2,6-cyclolycopene-1,5-diols A and B, which are only present in tomatoes in extremely low concentrations, have been isolated and identified in human serum, milk, organs (liver, lung, breast, liver, prostate, colon) and skin. Carotenoids may also play an important role in the prevention of age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, and other blinding disorders. Among 25 dietary carotenoids and nine metabolites routinely found in human serum, mainly (3R,3'R,6'R)-lutein, (3R,3'R)-zeaxanthin, lycopene, and their metabolites were detected in ocular tissues. In this review we identified and quantified the complete spectrum of carotenoids from pooled human retinal pigment epithelium, ciliary body, iris, lens, and in the uveal tract and in other tissues of the human eye to gain a better insight into the metabolic pathways of ocular carotenoids. Although (3R,3'R,6'R)-lutein, (3R,3'R)-zeaxanthin, and their metabolites constitute the major carotenoids in human ocular tissues, lycopene and a wide range of dietary carotenoids have been detected in high concentrations in ciliary body and retinal pigment epithelium. The possible role of lycopene and other dietary carotenoids in the prevention of age-related macular degeneration and other eye diseases is discussed.","Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)","['D016588', 'D000975', 'D002338', 'D004032', 'D005123', 'D006801', 'D018551', 'D008895', 'D015394', 'D010084']","['Anticarcinogenic Agents', 'Antioxidants', 'Carotenoids', 'Diet', 'Eye', 'Humans', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Milk, Human', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxidation-Reduction']","Chemistry, distribution, and metabolism of tomato carotenoids and their impact on human health.","['Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None]","['chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12424324,2002,0
12381334,"In the last few years, a variety of experimental and clinical studies concerning the formation, metabolism, and cellular effects of cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) have been carried out. Nevertheless, a substantial lack of knowledge exists regarding the possible intake of these compounds by the newborn through human and/or adapted formula milk. As far as the pathological role of COPs is concerned, exhaustive studies have shown that since dietary COPs are cytotoxic and atherotoxic, they may lead to adverse effects on health. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible development of cholesterol oxidation in adapted formula and in human milk by comparing the main cholesterol oxidation biomarker (7-ketocholesterol) concentration in both. To do so, the total (bonded and free) 7-ketocholesterol content was measured in ten fresh human mature milk samples and in ten milk adapted formula samples by high performance liquid chromatography and diode array detection. The 7-ketocholesterol human milk content (0.7+/-0.3) was often below the quantifiable limit (0.5 microg/g of extracted lipids) while 7-ketocholesterol adapted milk concentrations were often above (3.6+/-4.0) this limit. The 7-ketocholesterol content of adapted formula samples was significantly higher as compared to human milk samples (P<0.05). This is the first study to provide data concerning the concentrations of cholesterol oxides in human milk and in formula milk. Our results clearly suggest that the manufacturing technologies employed and the nutrient extractive sources play a crucial role in the development of cholesterol oxides in the end product. Careful surveillance has to be paid in order to avoid alteration of bioactive properties of nutrients and/or development of potentially toxic derivative compounds.","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)","['D002784', 'D002851', 'D004791', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D007225', 'D007231', 'D007653', 'D008055', 'D008895']","['Cholesterol', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant Food', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Ketocholesterols', 'Lipids', 'Milk, Human']",7-ketocholesterol in human and adapted milk formulas.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12381334,2003,0

12062212,"Protein C (PC) is the pivotal anticoagulant and antithrombotic in the human coagulation cascade. PC deficiency can result in major medical problems such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), leading to tissue oxygen deprivation. PC treatment has no bleeding or skin necrosis problems because it circulates in the blood as a zymogen and is only activated when and where it is needed. One source of PC is transgenic animal milk. The major components in the milk, such as alpha-casein, beta-casein, kappa-casein, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin, are proteins that must be separated from PC. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) is an inexpensive separation technology with relatively high specificity, and it has great potential for difficult protein separations. After systematic studies of different chelator, metal ion and buffers, the combination of iminodiacetic acid (IDA) and Fe was found to be effective to separate PC from major milk components. alpha-Lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin fell through the column in the starting buffer.

12018413,"The equine alpha(s1)- and beta-caseins (CN) were purified by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and by reversed-phase HPLC. The alpha(s1)-, beta-, and kappa-CN were characterized either by monodimensional urea-PAGE or sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS)-PAGE or by bidimensional electrophoresis. Kappa-casein was characterized after electrophoresis by glycoprotein-specific staining. To identify alpha(s1)-CN without ambiguity, internal sequences were determined after trypsin or chymosin digestion of purified alpha(s1)-CN. These sequences, that could be estimated to correspond to 62% of the full protein, presented strong identities with regions of alpha(s1)-CN primary structures of other species. In particular, 51, 48, 43, and 40% identities were obtained with corresponding regions of sow, dromedary, cow, and human alpha(s1)-CN, respectively. On the other hand, trace amounts of equine gamma-CN-like and proteose peptone component 5-like peptides were found in the whole CN. They were identified by microsequencing and corresponded to beta-CN peptides generated by plasmin action on the whole CN. The equine alpha(s1), beta-, and kappa-CN were separated by bidimensional electrophoresis in numerous isoelectric variants with apparent isoelectric points distributed between pH 4.4 to 6.3, 4.4 to 5.9, and 3.5 to 5.5, respectively.

These foods were chosen for their relevance in human and animal nutrition and prepared as they are usually eaten by humans. As confirmed by further investigations the precaecal digestibility is a valuable measure for determining the availability of native B-vitamins. Therefore, pigs were fitted with an end-to-end ileo-rectal anastomosis for digesta passing straight from ileum to rectum, thus avoiding endogenous vitamin synthesis by the colon. Three weeks after surgery the digestibility experiments were carried out during which the animals were fed various experimental diets for a period of 12 days and digesta were collected quantitatively twice a day during the final 5 days of this period. The concentration of vitamin B6 in foods and chyme was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. Precaecal digestibility of vitamin B6 from all tested food sources ranged from 51 to 91% in the following order: cabbage diet > banana diet > fish diet > milk powder diet > brewer's yeast diet > soybeans diet > soybean meal diet > egg diet/corn diet > barley diet > wheat bran diet > rye diet.

To characterize this adduct, it was chromatographically compared with DNA adduct profiles generated in several in vitro and in vivo experimental systems. First, MCF-7 cells were exposed to a number of chemical carcinogens, that is, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), 4-OH-B[a]P, 9-OH-B[a]P, 11-OH-B[a]P, B[a]P-trans-4,5-dihydrodiol, 1-nitropyrene, 6-nitrochrysene, dibenzo[a,l]pyrene, benzo[c]phenanthrene, dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, 3-methylcholanthrene, and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine. Spot 1 was detected as a minor adduct in cells treated with B[a]P but not other compounds. Second, to determine whether Spot 1 is derived from lipid peroxidation products or estrogen metabolites, it was compared with adduct profiles of cells or DNAs exposed to 17beta-estradiol, 4-hydroxy estradiol, 4-hydroxynonenal, or oxidized oat oil. Spot 1 was not detectable in these samples. In addition, Spot 1 did not comigrate with the 1,N(2)-ethenodeoxyguanosine adduct standard. Third, to explore the mechanism of Spot 1 formation, it was compared with adduct profiles detected in DNA or mononucleotides reacted with BPDE, 1-OH-7,8-dihydrodiol of B[a]P, and 3-OH-7,8-dihydrodiol of B[a]P as well as in rats orally treated with B[a]P. Spot 1 comigrated with a minor adduct in BPDE-treated DNA during anion exchange rechromatography but these two adducts were separated by partition chromatography. Spot 1 also behaved in a manner that was very similar to that of the polar B[a]P adducts detected in rat liver, but the two adducts were separated by HPLC. Fourth, Spot 1 was compared with CD1 mice exposed to 7H-benzo[c]fluorene (B[c]F). Spot 1 from some patients comigrated with a major adduct induced by B[c]F. Finally, we found that the presence of Spot 1 in human breast tissues was not related to smoking status but, rather, with CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism. The CYP1A1 mutant carriers had a significantly higher frequency of this adduct than did the wild-type genotypes. Furthermore, individuals with Spot 1 had a significantly higher staining intensity for BPDE-PAH adducts in their tissue sections than those without it.

Although the association of lipid glycation with this process has recently been shown, the number of lipid glycation products in food and biological materials has not been clear. In this study, we synthesized the Amadori products derived from the glycation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), i.e., Amadori-PEs. Dioleoyl PE was incubated with glucose and lactose for 15 days, and the resultant Amadori-PEs were purified and isolated using solid phase extraction followed by HPLC. With this procedure, essentially pure (>98% purity) Amadori-PEs glycated with glucose (Glc-PE) and with lactose (Lac-PE) were obtained and used as standards in the subsequent studies. To determine the presence of Amadori-PEs in food and biological samples, the carbonyl group of Amadori-PEs was ultraviolet (UV)-labeled with 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone, and the labeled Amadori-PEs were analyzed with normal phase HPLC-UV (318 nm). The detection limit was 4.5 ng (5 pmol) for Glc-PE and 5.3 ng (5 pmol) for Lac-PE. Among the several food samples examined, infant formula and chocolate contained a high amount of both Glc-PE and Lac-PE over wide concentration ranges, such as 1.5-112 microg/g.

These organochlorine levels were measured using gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry. By a self-administered dietary history questionnaire, the usual dietary intake was estimated. Their median levels (range) were as follows: beta-HCH, 0.50 (0.05-1.50); HCB, 0.20 (0.02-0.70); and total DDT (p,p'-DDE + p,p'-DDT), 5.0 (0.9-31.0) ng/ml serum. Levels of p,p'-DDD were detected in only seven subjects (0.05-0.6 ng/ml serum). The beta-HCH levels were increased with rice and milk intakes, but the least squares means were not simply increased according to the quartile of the intakes. Concerning HCB, fish intake showed a borderline significant correlation (0.20, P = 0.052). In terms of total DDT, intakes of meat, fish, vegetable and milk showed a positive relationship, although none of them provided statistically significant results.

11846168,"Chloroform, bromodichloromethane, chlorodibromomethane, and bromoform comprise the trihalomethanes, a group of widespread and mildly lipophilic compounds that result from water chlorination and other sources. Many animal studies show the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of these compounds, and recent work has demonstrated the importance of both ingestion and inhalation exposure pathways. This study presents partition coefficients describing the equilibrium among biological compartments (air, water, blood, milk, urine) for the four THMs based on results of headspace gas chromatographic analyses performed under equilibrium conditions and at 37 degrees C. The calculated partition coefficients ranged from 2.92 to 4.14 for blood/water, 1.54-2.85 for milk/blood, and 3.41-4.93 for blood/urine, with the lowest being chloroform and the highest being bromoform. Both human and cow milk were tested, with similar results. The available samples of human milk may not fully account for differences in lipid content and possibly other factors that affect estimates of partition coefficients. Simultaneous measurements of milk and blood in exposed individuals are suggested to confirm laboratory results. Partition coefficients are predicted using the octanol-air partition coefficient, also measured in this study, and the octanol-water partition coefficient. Results are similar to literature estimates for liquid/air partitioning of chloroform and chlorodibromomethane, but they differ from predictions based on hydrophobicity and lipid content. High correlations between the derived partitioned coefficients and the molecular structure (number of Br atoms) and physical properties (molecular weight and boiling point) are found for these analogous chemicals. In humans, THMs are both stored and metabolized with relatively rapid clearance rates. The derived partition coefficients can help to interpret results of biological monitoring and predict the potential for the accumulation and transfer of chemicals, specifically by the application of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models.

Fat losses due to heat treatment have been extensively studied in cow milk but have received little attention in human milk. We studied the effect of human milk pasteurization and sterilization on total fat content available to the infant as well as on fatty acid composition. Milk samples from 12 mothers (days 5-35 of lactation) were divided into three equal parts: one remained fresh, one was pasteurized (62.5 degrees C for 30min), and one was sterilized (120 degrees C for 30min). Fat content was determined gravimetrically, and the contribution of 30 fatty acids was determined by gas chromatography. For investigation of loss of available fat in sterilized milk, milk was collected from two additional mothers and analyzed with a modified extraction method. Total fat content was the same in fresh, pasteurized, and sterilized milk. The available fat content was 3.1+/-0.4g/dL (mean +/- SE) in fresh human milk, 3.1+/-0.4g/dL in pasteurized human milk, and 2.7+/-0.3g/dL (P < 0.001 vs. fresh) in sterilized human milk because of formation of a surface skin and fat adherence to the vial wall after sterilization. The fatty acid composition of 10 saturated, 10 monounsaturated, and 10 polyunsaturated fatty acids of both the n6 and n3 series was not affected by pasteurization. In sterilized milk there was a slight decrease of linoleic acid (C18:2n6; -0.7% vs. fresh; P = 0.006) and arachidonic acid (C20:4n6; -2.5%; P = 0.045).

11787717,"The presence of nutrient binders in milk may have an important role during milk production and may influence the nutrient's bioavailability to the infant. Human milk and plasma contain at least two types of vitamin B12 binders: transcobalamin II (TCII) and haptocorrin (Hc). Vitamin B12 in milk is exclusively bound to Hc (Hc-B12). In plasma, the major vitamin B12 binding protein that is responsible for delivering absorbed vitamin B12 to most tissues and cells is TCII (TCII-B12). Currently, little is known about the route of secretion of vitamin B12 into human milk. It is possible that a receptor-mediated pathway is involved, since maternal vitamin B12 supplementation increases the amount of the vitamin secreted into human milk if the mother's vitamin B12 consumption is low, but remains unchanged if her intake is adequate. In this study, we investigated the process by which the mammary gland acquires vitamin B12 from maternal circulation, whether as a free vitamin or as a Hc-B12 or TCII-B12 complex. TCII was purified from plasma incubated with [57Co]vit B12 (B12*), while Hc was purified from whey incubated with B12*. Both proteins were separated by fast protein liquid chromatography using gel filtration and anion-exchange columns. Purity of the separated proteins was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Binding studies were carried out on a monolayer of normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) at 4 degrees C using free B12* and TCII-B12* and Hc-B12* complexes. Minimal binding of free B12* and Hc-B12* to HMEC was observed; however, HMEC exhibited a high affinity for the TCII-B12* complex. This study suggests that a specific cell surface receptor for the TCII-B12 complex exists in the mammary gland. It is possible that once vitamin B12 is in the mammary gland it is transferred to Hc (which may be synthesized by the mammary gland) and then secreted into milk as a Hc-B12 complex.",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,"['D001940', 'D002478', 'D004847', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D008895', 'D014155', 'D014805']","['Breast', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Milk, Human', 'Transcobalamins', 'Vitamin B 12']",Binding of transcobalamin II by human mammary epithelial cells.,"['Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000302', 'Q000008']","['metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'chemistry', 'isolation & purification', 'administration & dosage']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11787717,2002,0
11787699,"Hemolytic uremic syndrome, a serious complication of Shiga toxin-associated diarrhea, is rare before 6 months of age. Immunologic and nonimmunologic factors present in human milk may partially explain this observation. In prior studies, we have demonstrated that human milk contains Gb3, the receptor for the B subunit of Shiga toxin, and also contains secretory IgA (sIgA) against the toxin. We therefore sought to determine the relative importance of milk glycolipid and toxin-specific sIgA in toxin binding. We studied two populations that differed in their frequency of exposure to Shiga toxin. Human milk samples obtained from healthy donors from Boston and Buenos Aires were separated by centrifugation into aqueous (antibody enriched) and cream (glycosphingolipid enriched) fractions. An emulsion of equal volumes of aqueous phase or cream layer of each sample and purified Shiga toxin was incubated, and the amount of free toxin present in each was determined by enzyme immunoassay. The cream layers bound 85%+/-2 (mean +/- SE) (Argentina milk samples) and 86%+/-1 (Boston milk samples) of Shiga toxin. In contrast, the soluble fraction in samples from Buenos Aires, a population expected to frequently have antibodies to Shiga toxin, bound more toxin (48%+/-2) than did this fraction in samples from Boston, an area where toxin exposure is infrequent (30%+/-3) (P < 0.0001). Toxin-binding lipids present in human milk are biologically active and may contribute to the putative protective effect of human milk. In a population frequently exposed to Shiga toxins (Argentina), protection may be due to both immune (sIgA), and nonimmune (lipid) factors present in human milk. In a population infrequently exposed to Shiga toxins, cream fraction-associated glycolipids represent the major toxin binding activity in human milk.",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,"['D001118', 'D001900', 'D002851', 'D005260', 'D006017', 'D006801', 'D008895', 'D022621']","['Argentina', 'Boston', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Glycolipids', 'Humans', 'Milk, Human', 'Shiga Toxin']",Human milk lipids bind Shiga toxin.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378']","[None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11787699,2002,0

We have shown that bovine alpha-lactalbumin also has antiproliferative effects in human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines. During a 5-day dose-dependent growth study, bovine alpha-lactalbumin was added to Caco-2 or HT-29 monolayers in amounts from 5 to 35 microg/mL. Low concentrations of alpha-lactalbumin (10-25 microg/mL) stimulated growth during the first 3 to 4 days. After growing for 4 days, proliferation ceased and viable cell numbers decreased dramatically in the alpha-lactalbumin-treated cultures, suggesting a delayed initiation of apoptosis. This experiment demonstrates the acute bioactive effects of small concentrations of alpha-lactalbumin, compared with the high concentrations of other proteins in the media. These results suggest that alpha-lactalbumin in milk may promote health by inhibiting growth of potential cancer cells.

Daily intakes of micronutrients were only about half of the daily intake estimated for non-Hispanic white females and infants in the U.S. NHANES III. Estimates of daily intakes from breast milk were also considerably lower for the migrant and Australian infants compared with the values extracted from tables of food composition and dietary recall for non-Hispanic white infants in the U.S. NHANES III. For example, Ca was a factor of approximately 3 times lower, Fe approximately 50, and Zn approximately 4. We consider our estimates a reliable indication of the daily intakes for several reasons, including the collection of up to nine quarterly collections of 6-day duplicate diets and retention of subjects in a longitudinal prospective study.

11694048,"Studies on camels' milk, whether with respect to concentration or bioavailability of trace elements from this milk, are limited and warrant further investigation. The object of this study was to analyse the concentration and distribution of zinc, copper, selenium, manganese and iron in camel milk compared to those in human milk, cows' milk and infant formula under similar experimental conditions. Camels' milk and cows' milk were collected from local farms, human milk samples were obtained from healthy donors in Kuwait and infant formula was purchased locally. Milk fractionation was performed by ultra-centrifugation and gelcolumn chromatography. The concentration of trace elements was analysed by atomic absorption spectrometry and that of protein was determined spectrophotometrically. The concentration of manganese and iron in camels' milk was remarkably higher (7-20-fold and 4-10-fold, respectively) than in human milk, cows' milk and infant formula. The zinc content of camels' milk was higher than that of human milk but slightly lower than in cows' milk and infant formula. The concentration of copper in camels' milk was similar to that of cows' milk but lower than in human milk and infant formula. The selenium content of camels' milk was comparable to those of other types of milk, Approximately 50-80% of zinc, copper and manganese in camels' milk were associated with the casein fraction, similar to that of cows' milk, The majority of selenium and iron in camels' milk was in association with the low molecular weight fraction, It is recommended that camels' milk be considered as a potential source of manganese, selenium and iron, perhaps not only for infants, but also for other groups suspected of mild deficiency of these elements.

Human BSSL has 16 successively repeated sequences in the carboxy terminal region. The sequence consists of 11 amino acid residues. The coding sequence for the middle 11 of the 16 repeats was removed from hBSSL cDNA to facilitate efficient secretory expression. The clone used for fermentation was a transformant of GS115 (his4) integrated with four copies of the expression cassette containing the modified hBSSL cDNA. Unique fermentation conditions were required for efficient expressions of rhBSSL in the high cell-density fermentation. A sufficient glycerol feed at 30 degrees C and pH 4 under an adequate concentration of dissolved oxygen in the growth phase make the cells active over a long induction period of approximately 15 days. On methanol induction, the concentration of dissolved oxygen should be maintained very low in the presence of sorbitol and skimmed milk at 20 degrees C and pH 5.7. Under these conditions, 0.8-1 g of rhBSSL was secreted in 1 liter of the medium.

11569765,"Residue analyses have been developed for hundreds of pesticides and their metabolites in foods. Normally, the fat is extracted with a non-polar solvent, followed by a re-extraction of the analytes into a polar solvent, removal of the remaining fat by several clean-up steps and finally determination by gas chromatography (GC). Over the last 3 years, experience has been gained in the use of laminar cup liners for GC injectors. The geometry of the laminar cup liner allows the injection of sample extracts with a residual fat content of tip to 5%. The cup prevents fatty compounds entering the capillary GC column. Using this approach, several residue methods can be simplified without losing precision or recovery. The preparation of the samples, such as cows milk, human milk, avocado and cosmetics can be reduced to one solvent extraction step with petroleum ether and one single cleanup step with an Extrelut column. No further clean up with Florisil or GPC is then necessary.

All mothers were on their habitual diet. Food records (95 items) were administered to the mothers, six-times during the first month of lactation (1 day after delivery, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after colostrum appearance) and referred to maternal dietary intake of the day before. Milk collected on day 1 was considered as colostrum, day 4 and 7 samples as transitional milk, and day 14, 21 and 28 samples as mature milk. Five gas chromatographic analyses were performed on each sample. Statistics were made using Friedman's and Pearson's test. Maternal dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were significantly related to the corresponding milk pattern in the phase of transitional milk (P<0.01), while total polyunsaturated (PUFAs) content was significantly related only to the mature milk (P<0.01); in this phase about 42% of the variations occurring in PUFAs milk content can be related to variation of maternal PUFAs dietary intake. The results in the present study provide evidence of the relationships between maternal diet and milk composition. The degree of correlation between maternal diet and PUFAs milk content increases throughout milk maturational process and reaches significance only in mature milk.

The contaminated sediment of the former seabed has been disseminated over the surrounding area by strong winds. This deterioration of the ecosystem has created a hazardous situation for the health of approximately 3.5 million people. This pilot study was undertaken to assist Karakalpak health workers in investigating the degree of exposure to metals, persistent organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and dioxins during the most vulnerable prenatal and postnatal period and to provide guidelines for future research. All subjects came from areas located within 200 km of the southern border of the Aral Sea. Blood was obtained from 18 pregnant women and 28 newborns (cord blood) to determine the levels of metals, lead, cadmium, zinc and selenium and the OCPs alpha-, beta- and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH; lindane is the product name of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and isomers and metabolites of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), i.e. op-DDT, pp-DDT, pp-DDE and pp-TDE. Levels of metals were also determined in blood from 28 non-pregnant women. In addition, levels of 17 dioxins were determined in 41 human milk samples and 1batch of formula. Information about possible dietary sources of the fat-soluble OCPs and dioxins was obtained from a pooled sample of butter and from seven cottonseed oil samples. A mass-selective detector coupled to a gas chromatograph equipped with a large volume injector was used to analyse the selected OCPs, whereas the dioxins were determined by gas chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry. The levels of metals in cord and maternal blood were consistent with concentrations observed in European countries. Only three women (7%) had lead levels greater than 100 ppb. The most notable pollutants in maternal and cord blood were the OCPs, notably HCB, beta-HCH, pp-DDE and the most toxic dioxin, 2,3,7,8-TCDD, when calculated as TEQs. A similar pattern was observed in human milk: beta-HCH and pp-DDE levels of more than 1,000 ng g(-1) fat were found in 68 and 43% of the subjects, respectively. Levels of 2,3,7,8-TCDD were six times higher than those observed in Western Europe. Traces of pp-DDE were detected in the batch of formula milk.

11448582,"Although it is accepted that dietary fiber probably is not needed in the diets of infants younger than 1 y, babies suffering from regurgitation are often fed with infant formulas thickened with considerable amounts of fiber. The effect of increasing amounts of alginic acid, locust-bean gum, and guar gum was studied from casein and whey-based infant formulas. A dialysis in vitro method with preliminary intraluminal digestion, adapted to the conditions of infants younger than 6 mo, was used. Human milk was used as the reference standard. Elemental contents of samples and dialysates were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Soluble dietary fiber inhibited mineral availability more in casein than in whey-based formulas. Mineral availabilities from casein- and whey-based formulas supplemented with 0.42 g of locust-bean gum/100 mL were 9.4% (0.7) and 10.4% (0.6) for calcium (P < 0.05), 0.32% (0.08) and 1.45% (0.17) for iron (P < 0.05), and 3.2% (0.2) and 5.6% (0.5) for zinc (P < 0.05), respectively. Calcium availability from the whey formula decreased in the presence of each fiber source, especially guar gum and alginic acid. Supplementing 2 g of alginic acid-based agents per 100 mL depressed calcium availability from 13.3% (1.2) to 5.3% (0.3; P < 0.05). With respect to iron and zinc, availabilities increased from 1.28% (0.28) to 6.05% (0.96; P < 0.05) and from 6.7% (0.6) to 10.2% (1.0), respectively, with the addition of 2 g of alginic acid (P < 0.05). Both gums lowered iron and zinc availabilities, and guar gum affected iron availability more severely than locust-bean gum did. Iron availabilities were 1.45% (0.17) from formula thickened with locust-bean gum (0.42 g/100 mL) and 0.92% (0.15) from formula thickened with guar gum (P < 0.05). Adding thickening agents based on soluble dietary fiber to traditional infant formulas probably affects calcium, iron, and zinc availability in various ways.","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)","['D000464', 'D001682', 'D002136', 'D003956', 'D004043', 'D005685', 'D020723', 'D006603', 'D006801', 'D007225', 'D007227', 'D007231', 'D007408', 'D019266', 'D008351', 'D008895', 'D008954', 'D053149', 'D011134', 'D013054', 'D015032']","['Alginates', 'Biological Availability', 'Calcium, Dietary', 'Dialysis', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Galactans', 'Glucuronic Acid', 'Hexuronic Acids', 'Humans', 'Infant Food', 'Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Iron, Dietary', 'Mannans', 'Milk, Human', 'Models, Biological', 'Plant Gums', 'Polysaccharides', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Zinc']","Effect of thickening agents, based on soluble dietary fiber, on the availability of calcium, iron, and zinc from infant formulas.","['Q000008', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000008', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000032', 'Q000008', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000008', None, 'Q000032']","['administration & dosage', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'administration & dosage', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, 'drug effects', 'analysis', 'administration & dosage', 'chemistry', None, None, 'administration & dosage', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11448582,2002,0

11417644,"A peer-verified, solid-phase extraction (SPE)/anion exchange liquid chromatographic method is presented for the determination of niacin in milk-based and soy-based infant formula. Analysis is in 3 steps: test sample digestion, extraction/cleanup, and liquid chromatography (LC). Digestion uses a standard AOAC digestion procedure that involves autoclaving at 121 degrees C for 45 min in (1 + 1) H2SO4 to free endogenous niacin from protein and to convert added niacinamide to niacin. The digest solution is adjusted to pH 6.5 with 7.5M NaOH. Acidification to pH <1.0 with (1 + 1) H2SO4 precipitates the protein. The clarified solution is then filtered, and the filtrate is brought to volume. SPE of niacin is accomplished by passing an aliquot of the digest solution through an aromatic sulfonic acid-SPE (ArSCX-SPE) column. After the column is washed with methanol and water to remove extraneous material, the niacin is eluted with 0.25M sodium acetate/acetic acid buffer at pH 5.6. An anion-exchange polystyrene-divinylbenzene column with 0.1 M sodium acetate/acetic acid buffer at pH 4.0 is used for LC. Niacin is determined by UV detection at 260 nm.

11404845,"Rapid analysis of molecular mass distributions of triacylglycerol (TAG) mixtures and regioisomeric structures of selected molecular mass species is possible using ammonia negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry utilizing sample introduction by direct exposure probe. However, interpretation of spectra and calculation of results is time consuming, thus lengthening the total analysis time. To facilitate result calculation a software package (MSPECTRA 1.3) was developed and applied to automatic processing of triacylglycerol molecular mass distribution spectra and collision induced dissociation (CID) product ion spectra. The program is capable of identifying triacylglycerol molecular mass species possessing different ACN:DB (acyl carbon number:number of double bonds) ratios on the basis of m/z values of [M - H](-) ions. In addition to such identification the program also corrects spectra for abundances of naturally occurring (13)C isotopes and calculates relative proportions of triacylglycerol molecular species in the analyzed samples. If several replicate spectra are processed simultaneously the program automatically calculates an average and standard deviation of relative proportions of molecular species. In the case of CID spectra the program identifies fatty acid fragment ions [RCO(2)](-) and the corresponding [M - H - RCO(2)H - 100](-) ions, and calculates the relative proportions of ions in both groups. These proportions are then used automatically to calculate the fatty acid combinations comprising the parent triacylglycerol molecule and the regiospecific positions of fatty acids. Processing of several replicate product ion spectra simultaneously produces averaged proportions of regioisomers comprising the parent triacylglycerol molecular species and the standard deviation of the analysis. The performance of the program was tested by analyzing triacylglycerol samples of human milk, human milk substitutes, human chylomicron and cocoa butter, and by comparing results obtained by automated processing of the data with manually calculated results.",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"['D000641', 'D001331', 'D002914', 'D003627', 'D004041', 'D006801', 'D008895', 'D008970', 'D012984', 'D018629', 'D013237', 'D014280']","['Ammonia', 'Automation', 'Chylomicrons', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Dietary Fats', 'Humans', 'Milk, Human', 'Molecular Weight', 'Software', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Triglycerides']",Software (MSPECTRA) for automatic interpretation of triacylglycerol molecular mass distribution spectra and collision induced dissociation product ion spectra obtained by ammonia negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'methods', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11404845,2001,0

11358181,"Dioxins/furans are ubiquitous environmental contaminants whose primary route of human exposure occurs via the consumption of fatty foods of animal origin. The US FDA conducted a market basket survey of dairy products and commercial fish and shellfish to obtain data on levels of 17 dioxin/furan congeners (2, 3, 7, 8-congeners) in the US. The dairy products sampled included various cheeses (American, cheddar, Swiss, cottage), ice cream, yogurt, butter, and milk. The finfish and shellfish (molluscs and crustacea) sampled are those marine species consumed in the greatest amounts and include canned tuna, shrimp, cod, blue crab, and oysters. Catfish was sampled because it is the dominant aquaculture species. Samples were collected in 1995/96 and analysis for 17 dioxin/furan congeners was performed by high-resolution gas chromatography following extraction and clean-up. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for each congener in each food were reported. Point estimates of exposure were calculated using a 3-day (1-day diary plus 2-day recall) food consumption survey for eaters-only and for the general population (USDA/CSFII, 1989-92). Toxicity equivalency factors (TEFs) developed by the World Health Organization (1997) were used to derive overall dioxin/furan toxicity equivalents (TEQ) for each sample food. Mean estimates of TEQ exposure for each food were derived using five values for non-detects (ND = 0; ND = 1/2 LOD or LOQ, ND = LOD or LOQ) on both a total sample and eaters-only basis. Using zero and the LOD provide lower and upper bounds on the range of estimated exposure, respectively. The bounds on mean dioxin intakes (pg/person/day) calculated for consumers of specific foods were estimated as follows (using zero or LOD for non-detects): butter (0.5-11), cheese (1.6-3.2), ice cream (4-19), yogurt (0.8-28), catfish (148-150), fish (other than catfish) (0.03-9), crustacea (32-35), mollusks (16.1-16.6), and shrimp (0.09-4.5).

11303465,"A method for in vitro determination of available calcium, iron and zinc content from infant food after digestion was evaluated. This method introduced an intraluminal digestive phase, adapted to the gastrointestinal conditions of infants younger than 6 months of age, prior to continuous flow dialysis of the resultant gastric digest. Precautions handling the method were discussed and enzymatic parameters were defined. Ruggedness of the method was determined from the availability of calcium, iron and zinc at different gastrointestinal conditions. Availability of all three elements was higher at gastric pH of 2 (20.0 +/- 1.1% for calcium, 4.06 +/- 0.66% for iron and 17.5 +/- 1.3% for zinc), than from the normal procedure (pH 4) (15.6 +/- 1.2% for calcium, 1.18 +/- 0.26% for iron and 8.2 +/- 0.9% for zinc). At pH 5, however, calcium availability appeared to be lower (11.7 +/- 1.0%) (P < 0.05). The intestinal pH also had a major influence on the availability. At low intestinal pH (5.5), availability was 40.5 +/- 2.3% for calcium, 3.01 +/- 0.58% for iron and 26.8 +/- 1.8% for zinc, which was higher compared with the normal procedure (P < 0.05). Moreover, other factors, such as digestion time, mixing and filtration pressure, also affected the availability. Recovery tests yielded mean values of 94 +/- 3% for calcium, 109 +/- 9% for iron and 106 +/- 4% for zinc. Mean intra- and inter-batch precision of the availability procedure was 4.1 CV% and 6.6 CV% for calcium, 14.5 CV% and 19.2 CV% for iron, and 4.0 CV% and 13.6 CV% for zinc. The method provides adequate accuracy, acceptable precision and good recovery. It offers the advantage of being simple, rapid and inexpensive, since it takes only 1 day to run the whole availability procedure (including four replicates per sample), and the low costs of the dialysis equipment. It can therefore be considered as suitable for predicting the availability of essential elements from foods used during the first months of infancy.",International journal of food sciences and nutrition,"['D000704', 'D001682', 'D002118', 'D003956', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D007223', 'D007225', 'D007231', 'D007501', 'D008895', 'D008954', 'D015203', 'D013054', 'D015032']","['Analysis of Variance', 'Biological Availability', 'Calcium', 'Dialysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Food', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Iron', 'Milk, Human', 'Models, Biological', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Zinc']","A method for in vitro determination of calcium, iron and zinc availability from first-age infant formula and human milk.","[None, None, 'Q000493', 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000493', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000493']","[None, None, 'pharmacokinetics', 'methods', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'pharmacokinetics', 'chemistry', None, None, 'methods', 'pharmacokinetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11303465,2001,0
11270874,"A strategy was established for the identification of novel antimicrobial peptides from human milk. For the generation of bioactive peptides human milk was acidified and proteolyzed with pepsin simulating the digest in infants stomachs. Separation of proteins and resulting fragments was performed by means of reversed-phase chromatography detecting the antimicrobial activity of each fraction using a sensitive radial diffusion assay. In order to avoid the purification of the known abundant antimicrobial milk protein lysozyme, it was identified in HPLC fractions by its enzymatic activity and by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). On condition that lysozyme was not detectable and antibacterial activity of HPLC fractions was caused by a peptide, which was confirmed by proteolytic cleavage leading to a loss of activity, further purification was performed by consecutive chromatographic steps guided by the antibacterial assay. Using this strategy, an as yet unknown casein fragment exhibiting antimicrobial activity was purified in addition to antimicrobial lactoferrin fragments. The new antimicrobial peptide resembles a proteolytic fragment of human casein-K (residues 63-117) and inhibits the growth of gram-positive, gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts.

11252382,"Colostrum and milk are natural vehicles for acquiring passive immunity and are valuable tools for decreasing neonatant mortality from diarrheal disease. The effects of recombinant human protein C (rhPC) expression levels on endogenous immunoglobulin and transferrin content of the milk of different lineages of transgenic pigs were studied. The levels of rhPC in the milk ranged from 40 to 1200 microg/ml. Transgenic pigs with rhPC expression levels less than 500 microg/ml had no significant differences in milk protein composition with respect to nontransgenic pigs. A line of transgenic pigs having rhPC expression levels of 960-1200 microg/ml had two- to three-fold higher IgG, IgM, and secretory IgA concentrations compared to other transgenic and nontransgenic pig groups (P < 0.05), and four- to five-fold higher transferrin levels than nontransgenic pigs (P < 0.05). Changes in milk protein composition were not associated with mastitis or other pathologic disruption of epithelial cell junctions as indicated by normal casein and albumin levels in milk. Since IgG, IgM, secretory IgA, and transferrin are transported into the milk by transcytosis, higher levels of these proteins indicate that transcyctosis in the mammary epithelial cell was likely upregulated in pigs having high rhPC expression levels.

11177201,"Bioavailability of iron (Fe) from a low-Fe infant formula was determined by erythrocyte incorporation of 58Fe 14 d after administration in ten healthy, non-Fe-deficient infants. Two feeding protocols were compared, with each infant acting as his/her own control. At 140 and 154 d of age, infants were fed 1000 g of 58Fe-labelled formula (1.44 mg total Fe/1000 g) as six feeds over 24 h (Protocol A) or as two feeds/day on three consecutive days (Protocol B). A water solution with 57Fe and ascorbic acid was given separately as a reference dose in both study protocols. Erythrocyte incorporation of 58Fe and 57Fe was determined by thermal ionisation mass spectrometry. Geometric mean 58Fe incorporation was 7.6% (range 3.3-13.5%) with Protocol A as compared to 10.6% (range 6.7-18.6%) with Protocol B (P = 0.05); paired t test. Inter-individual variability of 58Fe was not reduced by correcting for the incorporation of 57Fe from the reference dose, or by correcting for plasma ferritin concentration.

11133176,"Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) derived from essential fatty acids (EFAs) play an important role in prenatal visual and neural development. Protein-energy malnutrition affects PUFA supply, and hence the synthesis of structural lipids during growth. Recently, some physiological studies reported abnormalities in the visual function of formula-fed infants relative to breast-fed infants. The purpose of our study was to assess whether fatty acid composition of the malnourished infant diet modifies the visual function and erythrocyte phospholipid fatty acid composition. Three groups of full-term malnourished infants were selected. Two groups received commercial formulas. One of them supplied linoleic and alpha -linolenic acid: Formula I (FI), and the other supplied, in addition, long-chain PUFAs from n-3 and n-6 series: Formula II (FII). A reference group of breast-fed infants was also enrolled. Visual function was assessed using full-field flash electroretinography, and the erythrocyte phospholipid fatty acid composition was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. Those infants receiving the supplemented formula (FII) exhibited a similar retinal function to that of breast-fed infants. However, normal results were not achieved when infants were fed on the FI formula. In all groups, the results were correlated with the proportion of docosahexaenoic acid in erythrocyte phospholipid fatty acid composition.

The following chemicals, which were present in some of the milk samples, were quantified by gas chromatography: residues of lindane (i.e., alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane [BHC], beta-BHC, gamma-BHC), delta-BHC, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p-DDE), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDD, and 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDT). With the assistance of a qualified dietitian, the mothers also completed a 7-d food-frequency questionnaire and provided additional personal information (e.g., educational level, profession, previous or present residence, use of pesticides, treatment of dermal scabies). Concentrations of gamma-BHC (i.e., lindane) were present in 57.1% of the samples (mean concentration = 0.58 microg/l [whole milk], range = nondetectable to 10.86 microg/l). Concentrations of alpha-BHC, beta-BHC, delta-BHC, p,p'-DDD, and p,p'-DDT were detected in 16%, 39.3%, 11.6%, 41%, and 55.3% of the samples, respectively. Moreover, p,p'-DDE, which was detected in all samples, ranged from 0.33 to 278 microg/l. Typically, the amounts of gamma-BHC and sigma-DDTs in breast milk were below the established acceptable daily intake value. Nonetheless, 3 of the 112 samples contained concentrations of sigma-DDT derivatives that exceeded the acceptable daily intake value established by the World Health Organisation in 1987. Concentrations of insecticides in breast milk were affected by dietary habits. Some women who consumed 7 (or more) portions of fresh vegetables per week had gamma-BHC concentrations in whole milk that exceeded 0.15 microg/l (odds ratio = 1.23 [95% confidence interval = 1.05, 1.44]; p = .006).

The immunologic determination of bovine beta-lactoglobulin (LG) concentration in human milk has been reported by several researchers, but the results are conflicting. Moreover, a strong cross-reactivity between antibodies to bovine beta-LG and human milk proteins and peptides was reported, throwing doubt on the reliability of radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection and quantification assays for bovine beta-LG in human milk. Thus, the goal of this study was to isolate human milk peptides with a molecular mass >or= 1,000 Da cross-reactive with antibodies to bovine beta-LG in order to identify possible common epitopes between human and bovine milk proteins. The proteins were first isolated by affinity chromatography with purified polyclonal antibodies to bovine beta-LG, followed by gel filtration fast phase liquid chromatography and reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography purification of the components specifically bound in the affinity separation step. Affinity-bound peptides were identified by determining their amino acid sequence. All the sequenced peptides belonged to the C-terminal part of human beta-casein, which confirms the cross-reactivity of human milk proteins and peptides with antibodies to bovine beta-LG and allows the identification of possible common epitopes between the two proteins. No bovine beta-LG peptides with a molecular mass >or= 1,000 Da were found in our milk samples from healthy mothers on a diet rich in bovine milk and dairy products.",The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,[],[],Identification of the human beta-casein C-terminal fragments that specifically bind to purified antibodies to bovine beta-lactoglobulin.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11002129,2005,0

The oligosaccharides were eluted stepwise using deionized water and three different concentrations of ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.8. The elution order of the compounds was determined directly by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) analysis of the AEC effluent without any cleanup or concentration steps. Up to a concentration of 500 mM ammonium acetate, the masses of acidic oligosaccharides could be detected by screening the fractions in an automated mode. The combination of the improved chromatographic procedure, the applied MALDI matrices, and operating parameters is suitable for the detection of neutral oligosaccharides as well as acidic oligosaccharides. The method provides high sensitivity and mass accuracy, including for the high-molecular-weight monosialylated oligosaccharides up to 2751.5 Da. The applied ionic strength of the anion-exchange eluents enables a rapid and an unambiguous composition assignment by MALDI-MS for neutral, monosialylated, and disialylated oligosaccharides from human milk.

BSSL is highly glycosylated and includes one site for N-glycosylation and several sites for O-glycosylation. BSSL has previously been found to express Lewis a, Lewis b, and Lewis x carbohydrate antigens. In this study, glycosylation of BSSL was studied at different times during lactation. BSSL was purified from milk collected individually from four donors at several different times during the first 6 months of lactation. The BSSL glycans were characterized through monosaccharide analysis, high-pH anion-exchange chromatography, matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry, and ELISA. Both total carbohydrate content and relative amount of sialic acid were higher in BSSL from the first lactation month as compared to BSSL from milk collected later in lactation. BSSL from the first lactation month also showed a different composition of sialylated O-linked glycans and the N-linked oligosaccharides consisted of lower amounts of fucosylated structures compared to later in lactation. We also found a gradual increase in the expression of the carbohydrate epitope Lewis x on BSSL throughout the lactation period.

10836532,"The increase, in the last two decades, in the application of silicones (polysiloxanes) and inorganic silicon compounds in medicine and the food industry, has exposed the human body to extensive contacts with these substances. Most silicone breast implants contain a gel consisting of a crosslinked silicone elastomer swollen by silicone oil (PDMS). Diffusion of PDMS through the silicone elastomer envelope and rupture of the envelope with release of the gel contents both occur clinically. The amount and distribution of silicone compounds in various tissues are key issues in the assessment of health problems connected with silicone implants. We have measured by GFAAS the Si content of tissues from normal and implant patients and the organic solvent extractable Si levels (assumed to be silicone), using careful control of sample collection and preparation. Whole blood levels were: implant patients mean 38.8 (SD 25.6) (microg/kg), controls mean 24.2 (SD 26.7) (microg/kg) in one study and subsequently 103.8 (SD 112.1) and 74.3 (SD 86.5) (microg/kg) in another study.

Monthly fecal samples were examined by a variety of methods, including bacteriological culture analysis, fluorescent in situ hybridization with group-specific DNA probes, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the V2-V3 region of 16S rRNA genes amplified by PCR, gas-liquid chromatography, and bacterial enzyme activity analysis. The composition of the Lactobacillus population of each subject was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of bacterial DNA digests in order to differentiate between DR20 and other strains present in the samples. Representative isolates of lactobacilli were identified to the species level by sequencing the V2-V3 region of their 16S rRNA genes and comparing the sequences obtained (BLAST search) to sequences in the GenBank database. DR20 was detected in the feces of all of the subjects during the test period, but at different frequencies. The presence of DR20 among the numerically predominant strains was related to the presence or absence of a stable indigenous population of lactobacilli during the control period. Strain DR20 did not persist at levels of >10(2) cells per g in the feces of most of the subjects after consumption of the product ceased; the only exception was one subject in which this strain was detected for 2 months during the posttest period.

It is of concern whether zinc and copper deficiency is present at birth and maternal blood and breast milk zinc and copper levels have any effect on this. The study sample included 155 neonates with gestational age 26-41 wks and birth weight 0.550-3.800 kg. Mother's serum, breast milk, neonate's serum, hair, urine samples were analysed for zinc and copper by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Gestational age was estimated either singly or by combination of date of last normal menses, fetal ultrasonography, and postnatal measures of physical and neurological development by clinical examination and weight by Secca electronic balance. The neonates were classified into term and preterm, small (SGA) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA). Neonates over 37 wks and 2.5 kg served as controls. To assess the dependency, relationship and effectiveness of quantitative predictive variables on the predictions of values, multiple regression analysis was used. Neonates between 26-30 wks gestational age and < 2.5 kg birth weight had significantly low serum zinc and copper. Breast milk zinc was low in mothers delivering preterm and < 2.5 kg neonates. Urinary copper and zinc levels were high in preterm appropriate for gestational age (Pre AGA) than term neonates.

10768733,"The possible protective effect of breast milk against atopic manifestations in infancy, i.e. atopic eczema and food allergy, has been controversial for the last decades. Besides the methodological problems, differences in the composition of human milk could explain these controversies. The aim of this study was to investigate the composition of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) levels to food proteins (ovalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin) and an inhalant allergen (cat) in milk from mothers of allergic and non-allergic children. Blood samples were obtained at birth and at 3 months from 120 children. Skin prick tests were performed at 6, 12 and 18 months, and the development of atopic diseases was assessed in the children. Breast milk samples were collected from their mothers at birth and monthly during the lactation period. Milk PUFA composition was measured by gas chromatography, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure total S-IgA, anti-cat S-IgA, anti-ovalbumin S-IgA, and anti-beta-lactoglobulin S-IgA. Allergic disease developed in 44/120 children (22/63 children of allergic mothers and 22/57 children of non-allergic mothers). Lower levels of eicosapentaenoic acid, C20:5 n-3 (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid C22:5 n-3 (DPA), and docosatetraenoic acid C22:4 n-6 (DHA) (p < 0.05 for all) were found in mature milk from mothers of allergic as compared to milk from mothers of non-allergic children. The total n-6:total n-3 and the arachidonic acid, C20:4 n-6 (AA):EPA ratios were significantly lower in transitional and mature milk from mothers of allergic children, as compared to milk from mothers of non-allergic children. The PUFA levels in serum of allergic and non-allergic children were largely similar, except for higher levels of C22:4 n-6 and C22:5 n-6 (p < 0.05 for both) and a higher AA:EPA ratio in serum phospholipids in the former group (p < 0.05). Changes in the levels of milk PUFA were reflected in changes in PUFA serum phospholipids, particularly for the n-6 PUFA. The AA: EPA ratio in maternal milk was related, however, to the AA:EPA only in serum from non-allergic children, while this was not the case in allergic children. The levels of total S-IgA, anti-cat S-IgA, anti-ovalbumin S-IgA, and anti-beta-lactoglobulin S-IgA in milk from mothers of allergic, as compared to non-allergic, children were similar through the first 3 months of lactation. Low levels of n-3 PUFA in human milk, and particularly a high AA:EPA ratio in maternal milk and serum phospholipids in the infants, were related to the development of symptoms of allergic disease at 18 months of age. The milk PUFA composition influenced the composition of PUFA in serum phospholipids of the children. We also showed that the lower levels of colostral anti-ovalbumin S-IgA and lower total S-IgA in mature milk from atopic mothers did not influence the development of allergic disease in the children up to 18 months of age. The findings indicate that low alpha-linolenic acid, C18:3 n-3 (LNA) and n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCP) 20-22 carbon chains, but not the levels of S-IgA antibodies to allergens, are related to the development of atopy in children.",Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology,"['D000818', 'D001942', 'D002415', 'D002675', 'D005231', 'D005260', 'D005512', 'D006801', 'D007071', 'D007223', 'D007231', 'D007782', 'D008895', 'D010047', 'D010743']","['Animals', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cats', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Female', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A, Secretory', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lactoglobulins', 'Milk, Human', 'Ovalbumin', 'Phospholipids']",Human milk polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids and secretory immunoglobulin A antibodies and early childhood allergy.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000097', None, 'Q000097', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000276', 'Q000737', 'Q000276', 'Q000097']","[None, None, None, None, 'blood', None, 'blood', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'immunology', 'chemistry', 'immunology', 'blood']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10768733,2000,0
10760289,"In this study alpha-lactalbumin was converted from the regular, native state to a folding variant with altered biological function. The folding variant was shown to induce apoptosis in tumor cells and immature cells, but healthy cells were resistant to this effect. Conversion to HAMLET (human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells) required partial unfolding of the protein and a specific fatty acid, C18:1, as a necessary cofactor. Conversion was achieved with alpha-lactalbumin derived from human milk whey and with recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli. We thus have identified the folding change and the fatty acid as two key elements that define HAMLET, the apoptosis-inducing functional state of alpha-lactalbumin. Although the environment in the mammary gland favors the native conformation of alpha-lactalbumin that serves as a specifier in the lactose synthase complex, the conditions under which HAMLET was formed resemble those in the stomach of the nursing child. Low pH is known to release Ca(2+) from the high-affinity Ca(2+)-binding site and to activate lipases that hydrolyze free fatty acids from milk triglycerides. We propose that this single amino acid polypeptide chain may perform vastly different biological functions depending on its folding state and the in vivo environment.

These peroxidases are known to play host defensive roles through antimicrobial activity. The goals of this study were to measure the peroxidase activity in mature human milk and to characterize the enzyme responsible for the activity. As determined using 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine as substrate, whey prepared from human milk samples obtained 1 and 5 months postpartum showed levels of peroxidase activity equivalent to 0.13 +/- 0.18 and 0.24 +/- 0.21 microg/mL bovine LPO (bLPO; n = 13), respectively. Whey from early milk was fractionated into two peaks of peroxidase activity by cation-exchange chromatography; the peroxidase in the first peak was sensitive to dapsone, which is an inhibitor of LPO, whereas the second peroxidase was not. Whey from mature milk showed only the first peak. Purified bLPO and MPO showed chromatographic behaviors that were similar to the first and second peaks, respectively. The dapsone-sensitive peroxidase from mature milk was further purified (952-fold from whey) by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. This preparation showed two bands with molecular masses of 80 and 90 kDa by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using an antibody against bLPO. After deglycosylation, two distinct proteins with lower molecular weights were observed. Amino acid sequencing indicated that both of these proteins are LPO.

Two 32P-labeled products with high and low electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide gel containing SDS were found after incubation of sIgA1 and sIgA2 with [gamma-32P]ATP. The product with low electrophoretic mobility was degraded in 10% trichloroacetic acid giving a radioactive background in lanes of the polyacrylamide gel. 32P-Labeled phospholipids were found among the phosphorylation products. Soluble and immobilized DNA increase lipid kinase activity of preparations of sIgA. In this case the secretory component and H-chains of sIgA were degraded. Fractions possessing lipid kinase activity were precipitated in the presence of heparin (1 mg/ml), and lipid kinase activity was separated from sIgA by gel-filtration in buffer containing 5% dioxane. 32P-Labeled products were formed in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP as well as [32P]ortho-phosphoric acid. The influence of heparin and synthetic deoxy- and ribooligonucleotides on casein kinase activity of sIgA3 was studied. It was observed that deoxyribooligonucleotides in micromolar concentrations increased the rate of casein phosphorylation in the presence of sIgA3 and [gamma-32P]ATP.

Compared with previous reports, the contents of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) in TL from Japanese women were higher than those from Chinese and Canadian women, which may be caused by different dietary habits and food types consumed by those populations. The contents of arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4n-6), EPA and DHA in PE and PI were much higher than those in PC. In addition, no significant correlation of EPA or DHA content was found between TL and PL.

The eluted fraction showed N-terminal and mass spectrometric identity with human milk alpha-lactalbumin, but native alpha-lactalbumin had no bactericidal effect. Spectroscopic analysis demonstrated that the active form of the molecule was in a different folding state, with secondary structure identical to alpha-lactalbumin from human milk whey, but fluctuating tertiary structure. Native alpha-lactalbumin could be converted to the active bactericidal form by ion-exchange chromatography in the presence of a cofactor from human milk casein, characterized as a C18:1 fatty acid.

10654158,"The hydrogen breath analysis test was performed in healthy Thai adults to determine lactitol tolerance. The study was conducted in 39 individuals (11 males and 28 females) aged 18-41 years. All volunteers agreed to participate in this study after the risks and benefits had been fully explained. Subjects were requested not to consume milk, milk products, or high-vegetable diets for a day and to fast from 10 p.m. of the day preceding the test day. After consumption of the test diet (12 and 20 g of lactose or lactitol, respectively, in 250 mL water), the subjects recorded the severity of symptoms for 24 hours. Breath samples were collected after fasting and after consumption of the test diet at 30 min intervals over the 7-hour study period. Breath samples were analyzed for hydrogen using gas chromatography. After consumption of 12 g lactose, the prevalence of lactose malabsorbers was established. The increment of a peak breath hydrogen level of > or = 20 ppm above the baseline level was used as an indicator of lactose malabsorption. The lactose malabsorbers were further classified as lactose tolerance or lactose intolerance according to the gastrointestinal symptoms observed. All 39 healthy Thai adults could be classified into 3 groups as follows: 9 (23%) lactose absorbers (LA), 15 (38.5%) lactose mal-absorber/tolerance (LMT), and 15 (38.5%) lactose mal-absorber/intolerance (LMI). Using the hydrogen breath test, 67% of the subjects were identified as lactitol intolerance after the consumption of 12 g lactitol. The lactitol intolerance comprised 53.8% of LMI, 34.6% of LMT, and 11.5% of LA. Among all subjects, one third of LA (33%), two thirds of LMT (60%), and 93% of LMI were lactitol intolerant. In addition, gastrointestinal symptoms such as flatulence and abdominal pain were most pronounced in LMI. Diarrhea was also a prominent manifestation after consumption of 12 g lactitol. Therefore, it was finally decided that 20 g lactose or lactitol were not given to LMI because of the risk of gastrointestinal symptoms. After high doses (20 g) of lactose and lactitol consumption, most LMT developed more symptoms than did LA and the main symptom was diarrhea. Consumption of 20 g lactose resulted in fewer symptoms than 20 g lactitol in both LA and LMT. On the basis of the hydrogen breath test, most LA tolerated 12 g lactitol without gastrointestinal symptoms except some flatulence whereas most LMT and LMI did not. Twenty g lactitol was not tolerated by both LA and LMT because there was diarrhea among the subjects, especially in LMT. Although the hydrogen breath analysis test is the best method for identification of lactose malabsorption, it is not the best method to identify lactitol intolerance. A hydrogen concentration of 15 ppm above the baseline level was found to be the best cut-off point to indicate lactitol intolerance although sensitivity was 85% and specificity only 38% in this study. It was further concluded that there is a greater susceptibility to lactitol in human lactose malabsorbers than in lactose absorbers.

With these two complexes, a study of static and dynamic extraction as a function of pressure (1000-2500 psi), temperature (40-160 degrees C), and presence of modifier (methanol) is performed. Under the best conditions, 5.6 mg of Pb(DDC)2 (2.3 mg of Pb2+) is recovered. The parameters are 2500 psi of pressure, 160 degrees C of temperature, 0.5 mL methanol (placed in a 10-mL extraction cell), 60.0 min of static extraction, and 2.0 min of dynamic extraction. It is necessary to add 3.0 mL of methanol to enhance efficiency on the MoO2(acac)2 complex recovery.

10626518,"The prophylactic benefit of breastfeeding against atopic disease is still controversial. It seems to be limited to infants with genetic propensities to allergy in combination with late solid food introduction. Lower levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in human milk have been related to atopy in children, stressing a non-specific role of nutritional components in the development of atopy. Nucleotides and polyamines have been related to intestinal integrity and immune function in infancy. The main sources of these nutrients are human milk nucleotides and polyamines early in life. Our aim was to study the composition of nucleotides and polyamines in colostrum and mature milk from atopic and non-atopic mothers and the relationship to sensitization against egg, milk or cat in their children during the first year of life. The nucleotide/nucleoside and polyamine levels were measured by HPLC in colostrum and in milk at 3 mo of lactation from mothers of 21 atopic and 14 non-atopic children. Among the mothers, 10 were atopic and 25 non-atopic. The nucleotides cytidine monophosphate (CMP), uridine monophosphate (UMP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and the nucleosides cytidine and uridine were detected in human milk. In colostrum, CMP dominated, and the levels increased in mature milk, while the levels of the other compounds remained constant. The nucleotide/nucleoside composition was similar in colostrum from all mothers independent of the development of sensitization in their babies, except for the higher cytidine levels in mature milk from atopic mothers of atopic babies, as compared to healthy mothers of atopic babies. The polyamine levels were similar in colostrum from atopic and non-atopic mothers. However, putrescine and spermine levels were lower in mature milk from atopic mothers than non-atopic mothers. No relationship was found between milk putrescine and spermine levels and development of atopy in the children.

10624712,"Phytoestrogenic isoflavones that are abundant in soybeans may be an important group of natural products that could play a critical role in preventing several chronic human diseases. To facilitate studying the relationship of soya exposure and chronic diseases, we report a simple method for measuring an isoflavone, genistein, in human urine and plasma. The method is a competitive enzyme-linked immunoassay that utilizes a conjugate of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and genistein as tracer and a monoclonal antibody to genistein (clone 10D8) generated through the 6-position of genistein. Genistein, in diluted hydrolyzed urine or plasma of subjects who ingested soy milk, competes with HRP-genistein conjugate for the binding sites of anti-genistein antibody on rabbit anti-mouse IgG-coated plates. After a one-hour incubation, the wall-bound genistein-HRP activity, after reaction with a chromogen, is measured colorimetrically at 450 nm and is inversely correlated with concentrations of genistein over the range of 0.1-32 ng/well.

This study investigated the postprandial plasma amino acid profiles of preterm infants fed with different dietary proteins at similar protein intakes during the first weeks of life. In 12 preterm infants, pre- and postprandial plasma amino acid concentrations were measured before the removal of an indwelling central venous catheter placed for parenteral nutrition. All infants received breast milk until the time of study. At the start day of the study, infants were randomized to receive a test meal of 10 ml/kg, either of breast milk fortified with breast milk protein to reach a protein content of 2.0 g/dl or of a bovine milk preterm formula with a protein content of 2.0 g/dl (whey/casein ratio 60/40). Five samples of 100 microl blood were obtained immediately before and 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after the test meal. The plasma amino acid analysis was performed by a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography based on o-phthaldialdehyde/2-mercaptoethanol pre-column derivatization. In both groups, the plasma amino acid concentrations increased within the first 30 min and the levels did not return to the preprandial baseline during the observation period. Fifteen minutes after the test meal, the plasma levels of all essential amino acids with the exception of histidine were higher in the bovine milk formula fed infants than in the fortified breast milk fed infants. The sum of plasma essential amino acid levels found in the formula fed infants were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the levels found in the fortified breast milk fed infants at 15, 30 and 45 min. The kinetics of individual amino acids were influenced by the different quality of the protein even when the intakes in the groups were similar, as demonstrated for histidine and phenylalanine. The data indicate that postprandial plasma amino acid concentrations depend significantly on the dietary amino acid source and cannot simply be calculated from the amino acid composition of dietary proteins. Therefore, postprandial plasma amino acid concentrations should be included in the nutritional evaluation of dietary proteins in preterm infants.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)","['D000596', 'D000818', 'D001942', 'D004044', 'D006801', 'D007223', 'D007225', 'D007231', 'D007234', 'D008892', 'D008895', 'D009753', 'D010288']","['Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Breast Feeding', 'Dietary Proteins', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Food', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature', 'Milk', 'Milk, Human', 'Nutritive Value', 'Parenteral Nutrition']",Postprandial plasma amino acids in preterm infants: influence of the protein source.,"['Q000097', None, None, 'Q000008', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000097', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None]","['blood', None, None, 'administration & dosage', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'blood', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10503690,1999,0

10488687,"The ontogeny of cytochrome P-450 isozymes (P450) in goat liver, lung and kidney was studied using anion exchange HPLC separation of solublized microsomal proteins and Western immunoblotting. Comparison of the overall HPLC profile of goat P450 isozymes between liver, lung and kidney showed that while the P450's of goat liver were equally separated into five peaks of isozyme(s), only two peaks constitute the majority of P450 isozyme(s) in lung and kidney, thus demonstrating the tissue specific differences in P450 isozyme distribution in goats. Immunoblotting analysis using polyclonal antibodies against rat CYP1B1, and mouse CYP1B1, polyaromatic hydrocarbon-regulated P450's, revealed that goat orthologs of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 are expressed constitutively in goats. The CYP1A1 was expressed in goat liver and lung as early as 1st day of age, and the levels of its expression in adult lung and liver were, respectively, 1.3 and 5.5 pmol per mg microsomal proteins. CYP1B1 was expressed in goat livers in substantial levels as of 1 week of age and increased thereafter to reach approximately 4.5 pmol per mg microsomal proteins in adult livers, while low level was detectable only in adult but not neonate lung tissues. Furthermore, polyclonal antibodies against rat CYP1A2 detected very high levels of CYP1A2 in livers of adult and 6 week old goats. The Ah receptor which controls the expression of CYP1A1/1A2 and CYP1B1, was detected in cytosolic fractions from these tissues as a 104 kDa and a minor level of the 106 kDa form. These are potentially very important findings in light of the role of CYP1A1/1A2 and CYP1B1 in activation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic amines and nitroaromatic hydrocarbons to genotoxic metabolites, and the health consequences of these metabolites on humans, as consumers of goat milk and meat. Using polyclonal antibodies against rat hepatic CYP2B1 and CYP3A1, the goat CYP2B and CYP3A forms were not detectable in livers of goats at any age, but lungs of adult and 6 week old goats expressed these two CYPs in levels equivalent to the livers of phenobarbital-induced rats. On the other hand, anti-rat CYP2C6 antibodies specifically detected two goat ortholog forms which were expressed in all three tissues and exhibited age-dependent changes.

During digestion of whey protein, CMP appeared rapidly as a single peak and in high amounts, whereas it is discharged slowly in moderate proportions with the casein meal. These results demonstrate that CMP is emptied from the stomach in significant amounts during milk products digestion and support the hypothesis that food-born peptides could exert a physiological function.

10367004,"The fat content and fatty acid (FA) composition of nearly 40 foods, currently consumed by 102 nursing Congolese mothers living in Brazzaville, were determined to assess their impact on mothers' essential fatty acid (EFA) intakes and breast milk FA. Data on mothers' milk FA and dietary habits which allowed food selection were recently published (Rocquelin et al., 1998). Most foods were locally produced. Food samples were collected at local markets, bleached if necessary to avoid microbial degradation, and stored at +4 degrees C or -20 degrees C. They were lyophilized upon their arrival in the laboratory before lipid analyses. FA composition of food lipids was determined by capillary gas chromatography. Staple diets included low-fat, high-carbohydrate foods (processed cassava roots, wheat bread) and high-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) foods: soybean oil (high in 18 : 2 n-6 and alpha-18 : 3 n-3), bushbutter (dacryodes edulis), peanuts, avocado (high in fat and 18 : 2 n-6), freshwater and salt-water fish (high in LC n-3 and/or n-6 PUFA), and leafy green vegetables (low in fat but very high in alpha-18 : 3 n-3). Their frequent consumption by nursing mothers provided enough EFA to meet requirements due to lactation. It also explains why mothers' breast milk was rich in C8-C14 saturated FA (26% of total FA) and in n-6, n-3 PUFA (respectively 15.0% and 2.4% of total FA) highly profitable for breastfed infants' development.

Two selected Bifidobacterium strains, designated HJ 30 and SI 31, showed considerably higher rates of survival when incubated in 50 mM phosphate buffer solution adjusted to pH 2.0 or 3.0 or in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.5 or 1.0% (w/v) bile salt.

Furthermore, a non-radioactive lipase assay was developed which is 100 times more sensitive than the conventional methods and allowed the characterization of the lipase activity of the enzyme. The lipase activity increased 42 times in the presence of 10 mM sodium taurocholate, which for the first time provides direct evidence that a bile salt-activated lipase (bp-BAL) was isolated from bovine pancreas. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that the N-terminal amino acid sequence of this lipase/esterase is 88% homologous to human milk BAL and human pancreatic BAL. Staining with various lectins showed that bp-BAL is a glycoprotein which contains fucose residues. Previously from bovine pancreas a lysophospholipase has been purified and a gene was cloned and sequenced encoding an enzyme with cholesterol esterase/lysophospholipase activity. Comparison of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of bp-BAL with the deduced amino acid sequence of the latter revealed that they are identical. Furthermore, the molecular weight of the purified bp-BAL of 63,000, as estimated by SDS-PAGE, is very similar to that of the purified lysophospholipase (65,000) and to the theoretical molecular weight of 65,147 of the cholesterol esterase/lysophospholipase.

One group of infants received a formula with a linoleic:alpha-linolenic acid ratio of 10:1 (MF group). Another group served as control and received their own mother's milk (HM group). Blood samples were taken at birth and at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 3 months of life. Plasma and RBC fatty acid composition were analyzed by gas liquid chromatography and results of total plasma lipids were expressed as concentrations by adding an internal standard. Concentrations of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids increased in total plasma lipids with age in all infants. In contrast, those fatty acids decreased when results were expressed as percentages of total fatty acids. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCP) decreased regardless of how results were expressed, but the absolute concentrations of these fatty acids in plasma available for tissue accretion were greater than suggested by the percentage results. Plasma and RBC docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) decreased in the MF group in comparison to the HM group. Arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) was lower in plasma of MF-fed infant but not in RBC phospholipids.

The concentration of lead, cadmium, and nickel in these tissues and fluids was estimated by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). Total mercury concentration was measured by cold vapor AAS. The results obtained are determined, first, by the level of local food consumption, especially fish and reindeer meat; second, by smoking habits; and, third, by industrial pollution of ambient air, fresh water, and snow cover. A comparison of the results of this study with those of the Inuit Health Survey has shown that the difference between the Canadian and Russian data can be explained by factors of differing diet and differing levels of industrial pollution.

The active fraction was purified from casein by anion exchange chromatography. Unlike other casein components the active fraction was retained by the ion exchanger and eluted after a high salt gradient. The active fraction showed N-terminal amino acid sequence identity with human milk alpha-lactalbumin and mass spectrometry ruled out post-translational modifications. Size exclusion chromatography resolved monomers and oligomers of alpha-lactalbumin that were characterized using UV absorbance, fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The high molecular weight oligomers were kinetically stable against dissociation into monomers and were found to have an essentially retained secondary structure but a less well organized tertiary structure. Comparison with native monomeric and molten globule alpha-lactalbumin showed that the active fraction contains oligomers of alpha-lactalbumin that have undergone a conformational switch toward a molten globule-like state.

10028681,"Niacin content must be included on food labels of infant formula products and bakery products containing enriched flour. Liquid chromatographic (LC) determination of niacin in complex food matrixes is complicated by the presence of endogenous compounds that absorb at the commonly used wave-length of 260 nm. Also, the presence of particulate matter in the standard sulfuric acid extraction procedure results in reduced life of LC columns and precolumns. A simple, rapid, solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure for separation and cleanup of niacin from a complex food matrix digest has been developed. By using a vacuum manifold with the SPE column system, multiple samples can be processed quickly and efficiently for LC analysis, compared with gravimetric column cleanup. Sulfuric acid sample digest is passed over an aromatic sulfonic acid cation-exchange (ArSCX-SPE) or a sulfonated Florisil SPE column. Niacin is eluted with 0.25M sodium acetate-acetic acid, pH 5.6 buffer in vacuo. LC chromatograms of the resulting eluate are free of interference from other components absorbing at 260 nm at the retention time of niacin. Validation of the method was obtained from agreement of analytical results on available reference materials. For both SPE methods, values for niacin in SRM 1846 Infant Formula (milk-based powder) were within uncertainty ranges of the certified value. Use of several calibration procedures (the LC computer program, a peak area response graphic standard curve, or the method of standard additions) with both SPE procedures resulted in niacin values for 3 RM-Wheat Flours (not certified for niacin) in agreement (90-105%) with their respective values reported in the literature. Several commercial wheat flours showed a broad 260 nm interference, resulting in high niacin values. Niacin recoveries from spiked soy-based liquid infant formulas ranged from 95-107% with the ArSCX-SPE column.

In the period 1993-95 blood and breast milk samples were collected from 94 delivering women in Yamal and Tajmyr Autonomous Regions of Siberia. Concentrations of chlorinated pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were determined by high resolution gas chromatography with electron capture detection. The POP levels in maternal plasma among the non-indigenous women were higher than the native population, especially in total PCB, HCHs (hexachlorocyclohexanes) and the DDT-group. The dietary questionnaires showed that the non-indigenous populations consumed considerably less local food items like reindeer meat and fresh water fish. There was no correlation between local food consumption and elevated levels of pollutants. Even if the indigenous groups had lower concentrations of the most important pollutants than the non-indigenous population, they were still higher than the levels measured in the Scandinavian countries of the AMAP-study and up to levels of medical concern.

9848516,"Soy-based infant formulas have been in use for >30 y. These formulas are manufactured from soy protein isolates and contain significant amounts of phytoestrogens of the isoflavone class. As determined by HPLC, the isoflavone compositions of commercially available formulas are similar qualitatively and quantitatively and are consistent with the isoflavone composition of soy protein isolates. Genistein, found predominantly in the form of glycosidic conjugates, accounts for >65% of the isoflavones in soy-based formulas. Total isoflavone concentrations of soy-based formulas prepared for infant feeding range from 32 to 47 mg/L, whereas isoflavone concentrations in human breast milk are only 5.6 +/- 4.4 microg/L (mean +/- SD, n = 9). Infants fed soy-based formulas are therefore exposed to 22-45 mg isoflavones/d (6-11 mg x kg body wt(-1) x d(-1)), whereas the intake of these phytoestrogens from human milk is negligible (<0.01 mg/d). The metabolic fate of isoflavones from soy-based infant formula is described. Plasma isoflavone concentrations reported previously for 4-mo-old infants fed soy-based formula were 654-1775 microg/L (mean: 979.7 microg/L: Lancet 1997:350;23-7), significantly higher than plasma concentrations of infants fed either cow-milk formula (mean +/- SD: 9.4 +/- 1.2 microg/L) or human breast milk (4.7 +/- 1.3 microg/L). The high steady state plasma concentration of isoflavones in infants fed soy-based formula is explained by reduced intestinal biotransformation, as evidenced by low or undetectable concentrations of equol and other metabolites, and is maintained by constant daily exposure from frequent feeding. Isoflavones circulate at concentrations that are 13,000-22,000-fold higher than plasma estradiol concentrations in early life.

As a result of kidney damage the urine of people exposed to heavy metals contains different low molecular weight proteins, oligopeptides and amino acids, indicating pathological changes. One of the proteins is a very specific metallopolythiopolypeptide--metallothionein (MT). Based on earlier investigations, a very good correlations has been found between the contents of metallothionein in urine and plasma and the concentration of heavy metals in the blood, urine, kidneys, liver and brain and general in level of exposition to heavy metals. The aim of our investigations was to carry out quantitative isolation of Zn-thionein (Zn-Th), in order to determine the level of exposition to heavy metals. For Zn-Th protein isolation by covalent affinity chromatography with thiol-disulphide interchange (CAC-TDI) was applied, which is a modern technique of separation of a high affinity, good repeatability and reproducibility, allowing specific isolation of the thiol-proteins CAC-TDI gel was used as a solid-phase extraction (SPE) support for preconcentration of Zn-Th protein and Zn bonded with Zn-Th from water, rine, plasma and breast milk samples. The investigations showed unfavourable effect of the support on separation of thiol proteins and good correlation between the concentration of MTs protein added to water, plasma and urine and the concentration of protein indirectly determined via atomic absorption spectrometric (AAS) method, by preconcentration on SPE support metals formerly bound with MT protein and absorbed on CAC-TDI gel and calculated from metals concentration.

These may be affected by genetic factors, including race and gender, and by the presence of abnormalities of growth or hormonal abnormalities such as occur in children with chronic illnesses. We have used multicompartmental studies to examine calcium kinetics in healthy children ranging in age from premature infants of 1-2 kg body weight through adolescence. These studies are performed using orally and intravenously administered stable isotopes of calcium. Sample collection requires multiple blood samples to be obtained during the initial time period after isotope dosing, which is feasible in older children using an indwelling catheter. We have found that the peak rate for both bone calcium deposition and removal occurs in girls during the year before menarche. Peak kinetic rates decrease in an exponential fashion post-menarche.

Soluble proteins were subjected to FPLC gel filtration (Superdex 200) and high molecular weight proteins were separated into fractions I-V. Immunological studies have been performed using Western blotting of whole milk, casein and whey fractions, and Superdex fractions I-V followed by incubation with a monoclonal antibody against the purified GPI anchor of the variant surface glycoprotein from Trypanosoma brucei brucei. We found that significant amounts of GPI-anchored proteins are secreted into human milk and pig's milk.

9727611,"The identity of a previously unrecognized conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomer, 7 trans, 9 cis-octadecadienoic acid (18:2) was confirmed in milk, cheese, beef, human milk, and human adipose tissue. The 7 trans, 9 cis-18:2 isomer was resolved chromatographically as the methyl ester by silver ion-high-performance liquid chromatography (Ag+-HPLC); it eluted after the major 9 cis, 11 trans-18:2 isomer (rumenic acid) in the natural products analyzed. In the biological matrices investigated by Ag+-HPLC, the 7 trans, 9 cis-18:2 peak was generally due to the most abundant minor CLA isomer, ranging in concentration from 3 to 16% of total CLA. By gas chromatography (GC) with long polar capillary columns, the methyl ester of 7 trans, 9 cis-18:2 was shown to elute near the leading edge of the major 9 cis, 11 trans-18:2 peak, while the 4,4-dimethyloxazoline (DMOX) derivative permitted partial resolution of these two CLA isomers. The DMOX derivative of this new CLA isomer was analyzed by gas chromatography-electron ionization mass spectrometry (GC-EIMS).

9709476,"The aim of this work was twofold: to study the binding pattern of trace elements in formulas as compared with breast milk and the relationship between trace elements in breast milk and in maternal dietary intake. To investigate the binding form of trace elements in these nutritive fluids, methods for protein separation were combined with methods for trace element determination in the eluted fractions. HPLC and ICP-AES or ICP-MS were coupled on-line for the simultaneous speciation of elements of nutritional interest, viz., Ca, K, Mg, P, S, Co, Cu, Fe, I, Mn, Mo, Se and Zn, and also the heavy metals Cd and Pb in both human mild whey and formulas. In order to minimize interactions between the labile metal protein complexes and the column material, size-exclusion chromatography was used for protein separation. The binding pattern of trace elements in formulas is significantly different from that in breast milk and depends on its main component (cow's milk or soy), its processing (hydrolysis) and the chemical form (inorganic) of the added compounds. For example, compared with breast-fed infants the iron supply of formula-fed infants is much higher (up to 20-fold); in addition, the binding forms of Fe are very different in the two fluids. This has to be evaluated with respect to interactions with other elements during intestinal uptake. The investigation of breast milk samples from different regions of the world showed comparable shapes for teh elution profiles and for Mo and Se a dependence on the regional maternal dietary intake. Speciation studies carried out on breast milk samples as a function of the selenium content showed significant changes in the zinc-binding pattern.

Silicon levels were analyzed in breast milk, whole blood, cow's milk, and 26 brands of infant formulas. Comparing implanted women to controls, mean silicon levels were not significantly different in breast milk (55.45 +/- 35 and 51.05 +/- 31 ng/ml, respectively) or in blood (79.29 +/- 87 and 103.76 +/- 112 ng/ml, respectively). Mean silicon level measured in store-bought cow's milk was 708.94 ng/ml, and that for 26 brands of commercially available infant formula was 4402.5 ng/ml (ng/ml = parts per billion).

Also, 32P-labeled low-molecular-weight non-protein products are formed which are visible as radioactive background on the polyacrylamide gel lanes during electrophoresis of Abs under denaturing conditions. Separation of sIgA from IgG using a DEAE-sorbent with subsequent gel-filtration in 0.05 M NaOH indicates that the low-molecular-weight substances partially remain tightly bound to sIgA and are separated only by gel-filtration in a buffer containing 5% dioxane (non-denaturing resolution) or by extraction of the sIgA pellet with the chloroform--methanol mixture (2:1). The 32P-labeled substances were separated by TLC in the system used for phospholipid chromatography forming two fractions (Rf 0.83 and 0.66) that were stained with iodine. The data suggest that the substances co-isolated with sIgA are phospholipids. At 25 nM ATP, casein and lipids are 32P-labeled. At 1 microM ATP, the sIgA polypeptides are also phosphorylated. Gentle removal of the lipids from Ab preparation enhanced 32P incorporation into casein and sIgA polypeptides.

The Hg-M in the human milk samples ranged from < 0.2 to 6.86 micrograms/L (median 0.37), in the formula milk samples from 0.4 to 2.5 micrograms/L (median 0.76). The Hg-M in the breast milk samples correlates positively with the number of maternal teeth with dental amalgam. The mean Hg-M of amalgam-free mothers was < 0.2 microgram/L, while milk from mothers with 1-4 amalgam fillings contained 0.57 microgram/L, with 5-7 fillings 0.50 microgram/L and with more than 7 fillings 2.11 micrograms/L.

Later on, the Hg-concentration in the breast milk was equal or even lower to that in formula milk. The higher Hg burden of infants' tissues from mothers with dental amalgam, as reported previously, must be explained (1) by a prenatal transfer of Hg from the mother's fillings through the placenta to the fetus, followed by a redistribution of this Hg in the body of the newborn, and (2) an additional burden via breast milk.

9600805,"Health risks from amalgam fillings are a subject of controversy. In Germany it is not advised to use amalgam fillings during breast feeding. Objectives of this study were to examine the concentration of mercury in human breast milk and the confounders which may modify the mercury levels. Women who gave birth between August 1995 and May 1996 in a district hospital were asked to participate in the study. The examination included a standardized anamnesis and an inspection of the teeth by an dentist. Blood and urine samples of 147 women and breast milk samples of 118 women were collected in the first week after birth. After 2 months of breast feeding a second breast milk sample was collected from 85 of women. Mercury was measured by cold-vapor atomic absorption spectrometry. The concentration of mercury in the breast milk collected immediately after birth showed a significant association with the number of amalgam fillings as well as with the frequency of meals. Urine mercury concentrations correlated with the number of amalgam fillings and amalgam surfaces. In the breast milk after 2 months of lactation, the concentrations were lower (mean: <0.25 microg/L; range <0.25-11.7 microg/L) compared with the first sample (mean: 0.90 microg/L; range <0.25-20. 3 microg/L) and were positively associated with the fish consumption but no longer with the number of the amalgam fillings.

Each child received two test meals labeled with 5.6 mg 57Fe and 3.0 mg 58Fe as ferrous sulfate on 2 consecutive days. Three different doses of ascorbic acid (0, 25, and 50 mg per 25-g serving) were evaluated in two separate studies by using a crossover design. Iron isotope ratios were measured by negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry. In the first study, iron absorption was significantly greater (P < 0.0001) after the addition of 25 mg ascorbic acid: geometric mean iron absorption was 1.6% (range: 0.9-4.2%) and 5.1% (2.2-17.3%) for the test meals containing 0 and 25 mg ascorbic acid, respectively. In the second study, a significant difference (P < 0.05) in iron absorption was observed when the ascorbic acid content was increased from 25 to 50 mg: geometric mean iron absorption was 5.4% (range: 2.7-10.8%) compared with 7.7% (range: 4.7-16.5%), respectively. The chocolate drink contained relatively high amounts of polyphenolic compounds, phytic acid, and calcium, all well-known inhibitors of iron absorption.

Depending on the regional selenium intake level three regions were defined within the total range of 90-980 microgram per day. The samples were analyzed by means of INAA for the determination of trace elements, including selenium and zinc. The significant inverse correlation between Se and Zn in breast milk found in former studies was confirmed. Investigation of the Zn-binding pattern in milk whey was carried out by an on-line combination HPLC (SEC) for protein separation and ICP-AES for element detection. Six Zn-binding compounds including citrate were detected. A highly significant negative correlation was found between the citrate, which is the main low-molecular Zn-binding compound, and the maternal daily selenium intake. We determined that the decrease in zinc concentration is due to a decrease in the citrate level, which depends on the selenium concentration in breast milk. The selenium concentration in breast milk is, in turn, proportional to the dietary intake. In addition, significant changes in the UV- and Zn-profiles were observed in the milk whey with the highest selenium content, indicating that above a certain maternal intake level substantial changes in the composition of mammary secretory cells occur.

Degradation of EGF was assessed by measuring the generation of acid soluble radioactivity or by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Incubation with gastric luminal fluids resulted in a time- and dose-dependent degradation of labeled and unlabeled EGF at pH 2.5 but not at pH 7.5. Duodenal luminal fluids, on the other hand, degraded EGF at pH 7.5 but not at pH 2.5. The rate of degradation of unlabeled EGF in gastric luminal fluids was nearly 12-fold higher than the rate of degradation of labeled EGF, whereas only a slight difference in rates of degradation of labeled and unlabeled EGF was observed in duodenal luminal fluids. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis detected three major degradation products that eluted with retention time of 17.5 min, 20.0 min, and 22.5 min that was associated with a reduction of intact EGF (retention time 23.5 min). Defatted and decaseinated supernatant of bovine milk effectively inhibited the degradation of EGF in both gastric and duodenal luminal fluids. Dietary derived protease inhibitors, such as soya bean trypsin inhibitor, lima bean trypsin inhibitor, egg white protease inhibitor, and Bowman-Birk protease inhibitor prevented EGF degradation in duodenal luminal fluids but failed to inhibit EGF degradation in gastric luminal fluids.

9512197,"Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCP) are thought to be required for optimal nervous system development in the newborn. A commercial milk formula containing LCP (Aptamil-LCP) with a fatty acid profile closely resembling breast milk, has recently been introduced for term infants. The absorption of fatty acids in term infants was examined in a double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing Aptamil-LCP (n = 20) and standard Aptamil (n = 20). Formula-fed newborn infants were studied from birth for 14 d. Fat balances (3 d) were performed from d 10. A 3-d stool collection was performed from d 10 in a parallel breastfed group (n = 21). Plasma samples were taken on d 6. Median fat excretion (mg kg[-1]) was 897.1, 615.0 and 355.2 with Aptamil, Aptamil-LCP and breastfeeding, respectively. The median total fat absorption coefficient in Aptamil-LCP-fed infants was higher than in those fed standard Aptamil (p < 0.01). These findings were accounted for by differences in the excretion and absorption of long-chain saturated fatty acids (C14:0, C16:0 and C18:0). Higher fat excretion was associated with bulkier and firmer stools. Only trace amounts of LCP were detected in the stools of all groups. This accounted for less than 4% of dietary intake in Aptamil-LCP-fed infants. No differences in the utilization of LCP from Aptamil-LCP and breast milk feeding were apparent. Plasma phospholipid fatty acid composition data reflected differences in dietary LCP intake. Thus, PL LCP levels were highest in the breastfed infants and lowest in the Aptamil-fed infants, with values for the Aptamil-LCP-fed group falling in between.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)","['D000704', 'D000886', 'D002845', 'D004311', 'D005231', 'D005243', 'D005260', 'D005865', 'D006801', 'D007225', 'D007231', 'D007408', 'D008297', 'D008895', 'D009751', 'D018709']","['Analysis of Variance', 'Anthropometry', 'Chromatography', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Infant Food', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Male', 'Milk, Human', 'Nutritional Requirements', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",Fatty acid balance studies in term infants fed formula milk containing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None]","[None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9512197,1998,0

The aim of this study was to fractionate these salivary globular structures for analytical and preparative purposes using a gel-filtration material capable of separating spherical particles up to 300-400 nm in diameter. Freshly obtained parotid saliva was applied to a Sephacryl S-1000 column. Peak fractions were collected and prepared for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or for amino acid analysis. Bovine milk was included as the casein micelles by TEM appear to be similar to the salivary aggregates and their elution profiles are known. The salivary globular structures were eluted in one major peak. TEM of negatively stained samples from the peak fractions demonstrated globular protein aggregates consistent with the salivary structures in parotid saliva. Amino acid analysis showed characteristic amino acid profiles with unusual high levels of proline, 40-45%. The casein micelles were eluted in one major peak and separated from the whey proteins. This study indicates that the salivary globular structures can be isolated by gel chromatography.

To investigate qualitative and quantitative individual variation of human milk oligosaccharides, a sensitive method for routine identification and quantification of intact milk oligosaccharides was developed and applied to milk samples from 50 donors. The isolated, reduced neutral oligosaccharide fractions were perbenzoylated, resolved by reversed-phase HPLC, and detected at 229 nm. This method resolves most structural isomers and does not require stringent removal of lactose. Peaks were detected at the low nanogram (pmol) level and peak areas were linear from 1 to 1000 micrograms for a standard oligosaccharide. Oligosaccharide samples equivalent to 1 microliter of human milk give optimum chromatographic separation and resolution. The method gives quantitative results comparable to those obtained with classic total sugar analyses, and has an average coefficient of variation of 13%. The 12 major peaks in human milk coeluted with authentic oligosaccharide standards ranging from tri- to octasaccharides, and their identities were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Significant individual variation exists in oligosaccharide profiles; almost 70% of samples contained 2'-fucosyllactose and lacto-N-fucopentaose I as the major oligosaccharides; for the remainder, the major oligosaccharides were 3-fucosytlactose and lacto-N-fucopentaose-II or lacto-N-fucopentaose-III.

Highly purified tryptic peptides from native and disulfide-bond-reduced alpha-La were obtained by reverse phase chromatography. By ELISA technique using immobilized native protein or peptides, 11 of the 19 sera reacted exclusively with intact protein while 8 of them also presented a specific IgE response to different tryptic peptides. Polyclonal IgE population specificity was not related to anti-bovine alpha-La IgE levels. Sequence (17G-K58) and larger peptides sharing this sequence were most strongly and frequently recognized. Competitive ELISA inhibition tests confirmed this IgE-specific response and gave also clear evidence for IgE binding to smaller peptides corresponding to sequences (6C-R10):S-S:(115L-L123) and (109A-L123).

The carbohydrate composition of oligosaccharides was mapped using sugar and methylation analyses, enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, and different separation techniques. Native BSSL was found to be highly glycosylated (19-26%). It contained a high amount of fucosylated oligosaccharides and expressed both Lewis a and Lewis b blood group antigens.

N-linked structures on native BSSL were identified as mainly mono- and disialylated biantennary complex type structures with or without fucose substitution. High-pH anion-exchange chromatography analysis indicated that the recombinant forms of BSSL contained similar types of N-glycan structures differing mainly in their content of sialic acid and by the absence of fucose residues. Native BSSL contained predominantly large O-linked oligosaccharides.

9382491,"Milk of transgenic pigs secreting recombinant human Protein C (rHPC) was used as a model system to determine the utility of aqueous two-phase extraction systems (ATPS) for the initial step in the purification of proteins from milk. The major challenges in purification of recombinant proteins from milk are removal of casein micelles (that foul processing equipment) and elimination of the host milk proteins from the final product. When milk was partitioned in ATPS composed of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and ammonium sulfate (AS), the phases were clarified and most of the caseins precipitated at the interphase. The partition coefficients of the major milk proteins and rHPC were dependent upon the molecular weight of the PEG used in the ATPS. Higher-partition coefficients of the major whey proteins, beta-lactoglobulin, and alpha-lactalbumin were observed in ATPS made up of lower molecular-weight PEG (1000 or 1450) as compared to systems using higher molecular-weight PEG. Lowering the pH of the ATPS from 7.5 to 6.0 resulted in increased precipitation of the caseins and decreased their concentration in both phases. rHPC had a partition coefficient of 0.04 in a system composed of AS and PEG 1450. The rHPC in pig milk was shown to be highly heterogenous by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The heterogeneity was owing to inefficient proteolytic processing of the single chain to the heterodimeric form and differences in glycosylation and other post-translational processing. Differential partitioning of the multiple forms of purified rHPC in the ATPS was not observed. rHPC after processing in ATPS was recovered in a clear phase free of most major milk proteins.

9224775,"Famciclovir, a 9-substituted guanine derivative, is a new antiviral agent which undergoes rapid hydrolysis and oxidation in man to yield the active antiherpes agent, penciclovir. Studies with human liver cytosol have indicated that the oxidation of the penultimate metabolite, 6-deoxypenciclovir, to penciclovir is catalyzed by the molybdenum hydroxylase, aldehyde oxidase. In the present study the oxidation of famciclovir and 6-deoxypenciclovir with partially purified molybdenum hydroxylases from human, guinea pig, rabbit, and rat livers and bovine milk xanthine oxidase has been investigated. Famciclovir and 6-deoxypenciclovir were oxidized predominantly to 6-oxo-famciclovir and penciclovir, respectively, by human, guinea pig, and rat liver aldehyde oxidase. Small amounts of 8-oxo and 6,8-dioxo-metabolites were also formed from each substrate. Famciclovir and 6-deoxypenciclovir were good substrates for rabbit liver aldehyde oxidase but, in each case, two major metabolites were formed. 6-Deoxypenciclovir was converted to penciclovir and 8-oxo-6-deoxypenciclovir in approximately equal quantities; famciclovir was oxidized to 6-oxo-famciclovir and a second metabolite which, on the basis of chromatographic and UV spectral data, was thought to be 8-oxo-famciclovir. Two groups of Sprague Dawley rats were identified; those containing hepatic aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase and those with only xanthine oxidase.

In the first part of the study, colostrum obtained from 36 normal delivery women and six kinds of infant formulas provided by three major milk companies were analyzed for their fatty acid composition using capillary gas-lipid chromatography. Although enriched with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the percent composition of DHA in the six infant formulas (0.15-0.21%) was significantly lower than that in the colostrum (1.1 +/- 0.54). Arachidonic acid (AA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were present in the colostrum but not detectable in the infant formulas. It is recommended that although the exact amount of specific fatty acids needed in the infant diet was not completely known, to be as close as possible to natural breast milk, the level of DHA, EPA and AA should be raised in the infant formulas. In the second part of the study, 19 pairs of maternal and cord blood were analyzed for their lipid profile. All samples were from normal vaginal delivery. The measurement of cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and free fatty acids was performed with commercially available enzymatic methods on an automated discrete random access analyzer. Total fatty acid was determined as described in the first part of the study. The results were analyzed with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. No correlation could be found between maternal and fetal concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids or total fatty acids. Correlation could be found in non-esterified fatty acids, in palmitic acids, and oleic acid levels.

Recombinant hLF expressed in the milk of transgenic mice (transgenic hLF) was compared with natural (human milk-derived) hLF. Immunological identity of the two forms was shown by double antibody immunoassays and the absence of an anti-hLF antibody response in transgenic mice on hyperimmunization with natural hLF. Mono S cation-exchange chromatography and N-terminal protein sequencing of transgenic and natural hLF revealed identical cationicity and N-terminal sequences. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and absorbance measurements of purified transgenic hLF showed this protein was 90% saturated with iron, whereas natural hLF is only 3% saturated. The pH-mediated release of iron from transgenic hLF was not different from that of iron-saturated natural hLF. Unsaturated transgenic hLF could be completely resaturated upon addition of iron. Slight differences in mobility between transgenic and natural hLF on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were abolished by enzymatic deglycosylation. Binding of transgenic and natural hLF to a range of ligands, including bacterial lipopolysaccharide, heparin, single-stranded DNA, Cibacron blue FG 3A, and lectins, was not different.

Many transcription factors and eukaryotic RNA polymerase II itself are also dynamically modified by Ser(Thr)-O-linked N-acetylglucosamine moieties (O-GlcNAc). Here we report that subpopulations of murine, bovine, and human estrogen receptors are modified by O-GlcNAc. O-GlcNAc moieties were detected on insect cell-expressed, mouse ER (mER) by probing with bovine milk galactosyltransferase, followed by structural analysis. Wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose affinity chromatography also readily detected terminal GlcNAc residues on subpopulations of ER purified from calf uterus, from human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), or from mER produced by in vitro translation. These data suggest that greater than 10% of these populations of estrogen receptors bear O-GlcNAc. Site mapping of insect cell expressed mER localized one major site of O-GlcNAc addition to Thr-575, within a PEST region of the carboxyl-terminal F domain. Based upon their relative resistance to both hexosaminidase and to in vitro galactosylation, O-GlcNAc moieties appear to be largely buried on native mER.

8839502,"Large amounts of choline are required in neonates for rapid organ growth and membrane biosynthesis. Human infants derive much of their choline from milk. In our study, mature human milk contained more phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholine than choline, phosphatidylcholine, or sphingomyelin (P < 0.01). Previous studies have not recognized that phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholine exist in human milk. Concentrations of choline compounds in mature milk of mothers giving birth to preterm or full-term infants were not significantly different. Infant formulas also contained choline and choline-containing compounds. In infant formulas derived from soy or bovine milk, unesterified choline, phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin concentrations varied greatly. All infant formulas contained significantly less phosphocholine than did human milk. Soy-derived formulas contained significantly less glycerophosphocholine (P < 0.01) and phosphocholine (P < 0.01) and more phosphatidylcholine (P < 0.01) than did human or bovine milk or bovine milk-derived infant formulas. Rat milk contained greater amounts of glycerophosphocholine (almost 75% of the total choline moiety in milk) and phosphocholine than did human milk. When dams were provided with either a control, choline-deficient, or choline-supplemented diet, milk composition reflected the choline content of the diet. Because there are competing demands for choline in neonates, it is important to ensure adequate availability through proper infant nutrition.

The rhPC was first purified at yields greater than 60 per cent using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the activation site on the heavy chain of hPC. Subsequent immunopurification with a calcium-dependent mAb directed to the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain of the light chain of hPC was used to fractionate a population having a higher specific anticoagulant activity in vitro. The higher percentages of Ca(2+)-dependent conformers isolated from the total rhPC by immunopurification correlated well with higher specific activity and lower expression.

8896284,"Many different analytical procedures for fatty acid analysis of infant formulae and human milk are described. The objective was to study possible pitfalls in the use of different acid-catalyzed procedures compared to a base-catalyzed procedure based on sodium-methoxide in methanol. The influence of the different methods on the relative fatty acid composition (wt% of total fatty acids) and the total fatty acid recovery rate (expressed as % of total lipids) was studied in two experimental LCP-containing formulae and a human milk sample. MeOH/HCl-procedures were found to result in an incomplete transesterification of triglycerides, if an additional nonpolar solvent like toluene or hexane is not added and a water-free preparation is not guaranteed. In infant formulae the low transesterification of triglycerides (up to only 37%) could result in an 100%-overestimation of the relative amount of LCP, if these fatty acids primarily derive from phospholipids. This is the case in infant formulae containing egg lipids as raw materials. In formula containing fish oils and in human milk the efficacy of esterification results in incorrect absolute amounts of fatty acids, but has no remarkable effect on the relative fatty acid distribution. This is due to the fact that in these samples LCP are primarily bound to triglycerides. Furthermore, in formulae based on butterfat the derivatization procedure should be designed in such a way that losses of short-chain fatty acids due to evaporation steps can be avoided. The procedure based on sodium methoxide was found to result in a satisfactory (about 90%) conversion of formula lipids and a reliable content of all individual fatty acids. Due to a possibly high amount of free fatty acids in human milk, which are not methylated by sodium-methoxide, caution is expressed about the use of this reagent for fatty acid analysis of mothers milk. It is concluded that accurate fatty acid analysis of infant formulae and human milk requires a careful and quantitative derivatization of both polar and nonpolar lipid classes. Sodium methoxide seems to be a reliable and time-saving method for routine fatty acid analysis of infant formulae, which should be validated by interlaboratory comparison. Anhydrous procedures based on methanolic hydrogen chloride including an additional nonpolar solvent are also suitable for infant formulae but seem to be preferable for human milk samples.",Zeitschrift fur Ernahrungswissenschaft,"['D002849', 'D005227', 'D006801', 'D007225', 'D007231', 'D050356', 'D008745', 'D008895']","['Chromatography, Gas', 'Fatty Acids', 'Humans', 'Infant Food', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Milk, Human']",Influence of the derivatization procedure on the results of the gaschromatographic fatty acid analysis of human milk and infant formulae.,"[None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8896284,1997,0

8877840,"Large amounts of the powerful pesticide sodium pentachlorophenol (Na-PCP) salt have been sprayed over vast areas in central China to control schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease of epidemic proportions. Approximately 6000 tons of Na-PCP are produced in China annually. Dioxins, a class of toxic, persistent compounds, are found as impurities in commercial Na-PCP products. These contaminants are released into the environment and significantly contribute to human exposure to dioxins in China. This study was carried out to determine dioxin levels in environmental and human tissue samples from one schistosomiasis area to evaluate the health risks associated with exposure to Na-PCP. Na-PCP pesticide was applied in 1972, 1973, and again in 1978. A total of approximately 454 tons and 902 tons of 5-ppm Na-PCP in water were sprayed over large land and lake problem schistosomiasis areas, respectively. The groups studied were (1) sprayers or handlers of Na-PCP, (2) persons living in the sprayed areas, and (3) persons living in unsprayed areas 300 km north of the sprayed lake located in a city in the Jiangxi province. Individual whole-blood and breast-milk samples were collected and later pooled for dioxin analysis. Also, a sample of commercial Na-PCP was collected. In addition, sediment samples from the lake where Na-PCP was sprayed were collected from four different sites and one control sample was collected from a non-schistosomiasis area. All of the samples were analyzed by high-resolution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. A sample of Na-PCP used in schistosomiasis regions was analyzed and levels of 2,3,7,8-substituted dibenzodioxin (PCDD) and dibenzofuran (PCDF) congeners were measured. In addition, the international dioxin toxic equivalent (I-TEQ) value of this sample was calculated. Total I-TEQ of 162 parts per billion (ppb) was found in the Chinese Na-PCP product. A pooled breast-milk sample from mothers, female agricultural workers who were born in the schistosomiasis areas where large amounts of Na-PCP were sprayed, had an I-TEQ of 5,4 parts per trillion (ppt), lipid, which was about double that of mothers from control regions, women born in areas not sprayed with Na-PCP (2.6 ppt, lipid). The dioxin I-TEQ values in human blood ranged from 9.0 (subjects 15 to 19 years of age) to 16.3 ppt, lipid (subjects 35 to 70 years of age) in the whole-blood samples from Na-PCP exposed persons, whereas the general population's whole-blood I-TEQs were 4.8 and 6.4 ppt, lipid, respectively. The PCDD/F congener distribution patterns in four sediment samples from schistosomiasis areas were similar to that of Na-PCP. By comparison of specific ""fingerprint"" congeners (higher chlorinated dioxins and the closely related dibenzofurans) in Na-PCP, human tissues, and sediment samples, we conclude that the chemical pesticide Na-PCP is a source of environmental and human dioxin exposure in the Chinese schistosomiasis area studied.

We evaluated plasma riboflavin and pyridoxine concentrations in VLBW infants who received PIF during their first postnatal month. Eighty-eight plasma and 124 urine samples were collected for riboflavin- and pyridoxine-concentration measurements from 57 clinically healthy VLBW infants weekly during their first postnatal month. Concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. At the time of the sample, patients were receiving > or = 80% of their total calories via enteral feedings. Plasma riboflavin concentrations rose from 45.3 +/- 7.3 ng/ml at baseline (mean +/- SEM) to 173.5 +/- 20.3 ng/ml by 1 week of age and remained at 177.3-199.7 ng/ml during the following three weekly measurements; values were up to 14-fold above baseline concentration. Urine riboflavin concentration increased from 534 +/- 137 ng/ml at baseline to 3,521 +/- 423 ng/ml by 1 week of age and remained at 4,451-5,216 ng/ml during the next 3 weeks.

Plasma and urine riboflavin and pyridoxine concentrations in enterally fed VLBW infants increased from baseline concentrations by 1 week of postnatal age and remained elevated for the first postnatal month.

In order to produce sufficient homogeneous enzyme for three-dimensional analysis, the human enzyme (hGal-T) has been expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, production scaled up to 187 U recombinant Gal-T (rGal-T) and purified. The purification protocol was based on chromatography on concanavalin-A-Sepharose followed by affinity chromatographies on GlcNAc-Sepharose and alpha-lactalbumin-Sepharose. Analysis by SDS/PAGE revealed hyperglycosylation at the single N-glycosylation site, preventing recognition by antibodies. Analysis by IEF revealed considerable heterogeneity of rGal-T. The N-glycan could be removed by treatment with endoglycosidase H (endo H). The N-deglycosylated form of rGal-T retained full activity and showed only three isoforms by IEF analysis.

The mother's diet is the source of human milk trans fatty acids, and since these fatty acids are prevalent in many common foods of the Canadian diet, the trans fatty acid content and the fatty acid composition of Canadian human milk were measured by gas-liquid chromatography coupled with silver nitrate-thin layer chromatography. In samples obtained from 198 lactating mothers across Canada, the average percentage of total trans (sum of t18:1, t18:2, and t18:3) was 7.2% of breast milk fatty acids with a range of 0.1-17.2%. Analysis of t18:1 isomer distribution indicated that partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are the major source of these trans fatty acids in human milk, whereas contribution from dairy products appeared to be relatively minor. Linoleic and alpha-linolenic acid levels were inversely related to the total trans fatty acids, indicating that the elevation of trans fatty acids in Canadian human milk is at the expense of n-3 and n-6 essential fatty acids. Levels of arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids did not correlate with their parent fatty acids, indicating that it might be difficult to elevate the levels of n-6 and n-3 c20-22 polyunsaturated fatty acids in breast milk by increasing levels of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids in the mother's diet.",Lipids,"['D002170', 'D004042', 'D015525', 'D043371', 'D005231', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D008895', 'D013237']","['Canada', 'Dietary Fats, Unsaturated', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-3', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-6', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Milk, Human', 'Stereoisomerism']","Trans, n-3, and n-6 fatty acids in Canadian human milk.","[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', None]","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8729134,1996,0

In the present study, we examined whether human lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) might contain protein(s) that could inhibit the endocytic uptake of oxLDL by mouse macrophages. We fractionated LPDS by heparin affinity chromatography and found that the cellular binding of oxLDL to mouse macrophages and subsequent endocytic uptake were inhibited by 50%-60% with the heparin-bound fraction, whereas the heparin-unbound fraction had no effect. Similar results were obtained in the experiments with acetylated LDL. Sephacryl S-300 gel-filtration chromatography of a mixture of oxLDL and the heparin-bound fraction revealed that a 150-kDa protein was associated with oxLDL.

However, by lowering the pH of a solubilized membrane preparation of this tissue to 3.5, the endogenous bound folate was dissociated from the protein and adsorbed to charcoal.

A single protein band with an apparent M(r) of 36,000 was observed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the eluate from the affinity matrix. Western blot of this preparation using a rabbit antiserum raised with the affinity eluate also identified a single 36 kDa protein band. However, peptide sequencing of the N-terminal region of the proteins in the affinity eluate established that it contained two homologous proteins. Computer alignment of the first 22 N-terminal amino acids of each rat placental protein with human, bovine milk and mouse folate binding proteins showed 50-64% identical homology and 27% homology when the eight proteins were aligned together. The affinity of both rat proteins is highest for pteroylglutamic acid (Ka = 1.6.10(9) l/mol) lower for N5-methyltetrahydrofolate and substantially lower for N5-formyltetrahydrofolate.

Both endogenous and newly added Cbl showed similar quantitative distribution between a 280 kDa protein complex (45%) and a 43 kDa Cbl-binder (55%). Long time incubation, as well as urea treatment, was accompanied by a slow release of the 43 kDa Cbl-binder from the 280 kDa fraction. No other Cbl-binding proteins appeared after these procedures. The 43 kDa binder from cow milk, depleted of the ligand by urea treatment, reacted with Cbl even in the presence of a B12-analogue cobinamide (Cbi) at the ratio Cbl:Cbi = 1:40. The stokes radius of the binder changed from 2.7 nm for the Cbl-free protein to 2.5 nm for the Cbl-saturated form and the Cbl-saturated binder was able to displace human transcobalamin (TC) from the TC-receptor. The interaction between the protein and Cbl was significantly suppressed at pH 2.0. The N-terminal sequence of the purified 43 kDa Cbl-binder revealed homology with TC from human and rabbit plasma.

Estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of DDT complex and gamma-HCH by breast-fed infants in Kafr El-Zayat were 85.96 and 3.1% of the respective acceptable daily intakes (ADIs). beta-HCH residues showed an increasing pattern, especially in human milk samples from Cairo. DDT complex and HCH isomers in orange, spinach, lettuce, potatoes, and clover samples ranged from undetectable to very low concentrations. Higher levels of DDT and HCH were detected, but aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, and the heptachlors were not detected in food of animal origin.

This fraction was a source of potent growth promoting activity for all mesodermal-derived cells tested, including human skin and embryonic lung fibroblasts, Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts, and rat L6 myoblasts. Maximal growth of all these cell types exceeded that observed in 10% fetal bovine serum. Feline kidney and baby hamster fibroblasts and Chinese hamster ovary cells were less responsive, achieving a maximal growth response of 50-75% that observed in 10% fetal bovine serum. Maximal growth achieved in whey-extract-supplemented cultures of Balb/c 3T3 and human skin fibroblasts, and L6 myoblast cultures exceeded that seen in response to recombinant acidic or basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, or epidermal growth factor. Importantly, addition of low concentrations of fetal bovine serum to the whey-derived mitogenic fraction produced an additive response.

8546886,"In the past few years, there has been an upsurge of interest in aluminum (Al) and human health. The well-recognized manifestations of systemic Al toxicity include fracturing osteomalacia, dialysis encephalopathy, and microcytic hypochromic anemia. The role of Al in causing childhood diseases is also becoming clearer, but the safe plasma level still remains to be determined in newborns, especially in premature newborns, implying that it should be kept low. Premature infants receiving iv fluid therapy show evidence of Al loading. Additionally, the infant-feeding mixtures, especially the soy-based infant formulas, tested may be a significant additional source of Al in the diet of infants with low birthweights, and in infants and in young children with impaired renal function. Careful clinical and biochemical monitoring is warranted to determine whether it will be necessary to eliminate Al contamination of both oral and parenteral preparations used in infants and children who may be at risk for Al intoxication. In this present study, the Al content of infant feeds was measured by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and also compared with those of breast milk, cow's milk, milk powder, and some starches that are commonly used for preparation of infant feed in Turkey. Our results show that Al content of commercially available powdered infant formulas, most of which are imported from Europe, ranged from 1.211 to 10.925 micrograms/g.

Supplementation of formula with 0.36% of total fatty acids as DHA resulted in erythrocyte DHA being maintained at or above breast-fed levels for the entire 30-wk study period, and breast feeding (0.21% DHA) resulted in a modest fall in erythrocyte DHA relative to baseline (day 5) values. The level of erythrocyte DHA in placebo formula-fed infants was halved by week 16. AA levels decreased in all infants in the first six weeks, but the levels in breast- and placebo formula-fed infants increased with age and returned to approximate baseline (day 5) values by 16 and 30 wk of age, respectively. Erythrocyte AA in FO+EPO-supplemented infants remained low and below breast- and placebo formula-fed levels.

8535240,"Osteopontin (OPN) is a multiphosphorylated glycoprotein found in bone and other normal and malignant tissues, as well as in the physiological fluids urine and milk. The present study demonstrates that bovine milk osteopontin is phosphorylated at 27 serine residues and 1 threonine residue. Phosphoamino acids were identified by a combination of amino acid analysis, sequence analysis of S-ethylcysteine-derivatized phosphopeptides, and mass spectrometric analysis. Twenty-five phosphoserines and one phosphothreonine were located in Ser/Thr-X-Glu/Ser(P)/Asp motifs, and two phosphoserines were found in the sequence Ser-X-X-Glu/Ser(P). These sequence motifs are identical with the recognition sequences of mammary gland casein kinase and casein kinase II, respectively. Examination of the phosphorylation pattern revealed that the phosphorylations were clustered in groups of approximately three spanned by unphosphorylated regions of 11-32 amino acids. This pattern is probably of importance in the multiple functions of OPN involving interaction with Ca2+ and inorganic calcium salts. Furthermore, three O-glycosylated threonines (Thr 115, Thr 124, and Thr 129) have been identified in a threonine- and proline-rich region of the protein. Three putative N-glycosylation sites (Asn 63, Asn 85, and Asn 193) are present in bovine osteopontin, but sequence and mass spectrometric analysis showed that none of these asparagines were glycosylated in bovine mammary gland osteopontin. Alignment analysis showed that the majority of the phosphorylation sites in bovine osteopontin as well as all three O-glycosylation sites were conserved in other mammalian sequences. This conservation of serines, even in otherwise less well-conserved regions of the protein, indicates that the phosphorylation of osteopontin at specific sites is essential for the function of the protein.",Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,"['D000595', 'D000818', 'D002417', 'D002851', 'D017124', 'D005260', 'D006031', 'D006801', 'D013058', 'D008892', 'D008969', 'D053495', 'D010446', 'D010750', 'D010766', 'D010768', 'D010769', 'D011487', 'D011499', 'D017386', 'D012694', 'D012795']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Female', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Milk', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Osteopontin', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphoserine', 'Phosphothreonine', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Serine', 'Sialoglycoproteins']",Posttranslational modifications of bovine osteopontin: identification of twenty-eight phosphorylation and three O-glycosylation sites.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8535240,1996,0

It has also been advocated that part of the antimicrobial activity of human milk resides in the caseins, most likely the glycosyated K-casein. Top explore this possibility, we purified K-casein from human milk to homogeneity by a two-step size-exclusion chromatography procedure. Purified human K-casein, in contrast to K-casein purified from bovine milk, effectively inhibited the cell lineage-specific adhesion of fluoroisothiocyanate-labeled Helicobacter pylori to human gastric surface mucous cells. The inhibitory activity was abolished by metaperiodate oxidation and considerably reduced by preincubation with alpha-L-fucosidase but not with alpha-N-acetylneuraminidase or endo-beta-galactosidase. These results strongly support the view that fucose containing carbohydrate moieties of human K-casein are important for inhibition of H. pylori adhesion and, thus, infection. They also suggest that breastfeeding may protect from infection by H. pylori during early life and that species-specific glycosylation patterns, as illustrated by human bovine K-casein, partly determine both the narrow host spectrum of this human gastric pathogen and the capacity to resist infection.",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,"['D000818', 'D001422', 'D002364', 'D002417', 'D002850', 'D003126', 'D005260', 'D005753', 'D016480', 'D006801', 'D008892', 'D008895']","['Animals', 'Bacterial Adhesion', 'Caseins', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Colostrum', 'Female', 'Gastric Mucosa', 'Helicobacter pylori', 'Humans', 'Milk', 'Milk, Human']",Human milk kappa-casein and inhibition of Helicobacter pylori adhesion to human gastric mucosa.,"[None, 'Q000187', 'Q000302', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000382', 'Q000502', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","[None, 'drug effects', 'isolation & purification', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'microbiology', 'physiology', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8523212,1996,0

7543886,"The ability of washed whole cells of Treponema denticola ATCC 35405 to hydrolyze (inactivate) substance P, bradykinin, and angiotensin I was studied. Substance P was attacked primarily at the Phe-8-Gly-9 bond by a chymotrypsin-like proteinase (CTLP), at Pro-4-Gln-5 by an endo-acting prolyl oligopeptidase (POPase), and at Gln-5-Gln-6 by an endopeptidase (FALGPA-peptidase). Bradykinin was cleaved at Phe-5-Ser-6 by the FALGPA-peptidase and at Pro-7-Phe-8 by the POPase. Angiotensin I was rapidly converted to angiotensin II by the CTLP, and both angiotensin I and angiotensin II were further hydrolyzed at Pro-7-Phe-8 by the POPase. All these enzymes were assumed to be cell associated and were easily extracted with a mild (0.05 to 0.1%) Triton X-100 treatment. Because it was conceivable that the hydrolysis of substance P at the Phe-8-Gly-9 bond was catalyzed by a CTLP described earlier (V.-J. Uitto, D. Grenier, E. C. S. Chan, and B. C. McBride, Infect. Immun. 56:2717-2722, 1988), the enzyme was purified to homogeneity by means of conventional fast protein liquid chromatography procedures. For kinetic studies, Phe-8(4-nitro)-substance P (NSP) (absorption maximum at 309.2 nm, epsilon = 545 M-1 cm-1) was synthesized to replace substance P as a substrate in kinetic studies. In reversed-phase chromatography, both NSP and substance P gave identical results with both whole cells and the purified enzyme. The CTLP has a mass of 95 kDa, and its activity is suggested to be based on an active seryl residue, on an active imidazole group, and on an active carboxyl group but not on metal cations. The enzyme hydrolyzes N-succinyl-L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Pro-L-Phe-p-nitroaniline (SAAPFNA, a typical chymotrypsin substrate) at a high rate and several proteins, such as calf thymus histone, human plasma fibrinogen, milk caseins, and gelatin. Among the substrates tested, substance P showed the highest affinity (Km = 0.22 mM) for the purified enzyme. Depending on conditions, clinically applicable chlorhexidine levels (3.2 mmol/liter, or 0.2%) strongly activated (up to fourfold) the hydrolysis of SAAPFNA by whole cells and the purified CTLP. The hydrolysis of NSP by whole cells and purified CTLP was slightly inhibited by chlorhexidine.

A large-scale purification method has been devised to purify the C-tail fragment from human milk BAL. Chymotryptic, tryptic, and cyanogen bromide cleavages of partially purified BAL and subsequent molecular sieve chromatography yielded 20-30 mg of C-tail fragment from 1 L of human milk. The N-terminal sequence and amino acid composition of the purified C-tail fragment establish that it is derived from residues 528-712 of the enzyme. The O-glycosylated carbohydrates of the C-tail fragment contain fucose, galactose, glucosamine, galactosamine, and neuraminic acid in a molar ratio of 1:3:2:1:0.3, respectively. beta-Elimination reaction revealed that nine threonine residues and less than one serine residue were glycosylated. Edman degradation of C-tail fragment and its pronase subfragment suggest a number of glycosylation sites which are flanked by a consensus motif of PVPP. We suggest that this motif may serve as a signal for O-glycosylation in the C-tail region of BAL. Immunochemical studies indicated that the oligosaccharide chains in the C-tail region of BAL contain Lewis x and Lewis a antigens and, less prominently, sialyl Lewis x and sialyl Lewis a antigens.

In artificial powdered formulas, the polyamine concentration was approximately 10 times lower than in human milk, with no difference in putrescine and spermine contents between first-age and second-age formulas. By contrast, semi-elemental diets prepared by hydrolytic procedures using crude extracts of pancreatic enzymes were shown to be major sources of polyamines with a profile similar to that of human milk. Compared with first-age formulas, mean concentrations in spermine and spermidine were 39 and six times higher, respectively, in these semi-elemental diets, whereas putrescine levels remained almost equivalent in all types of milk tested.

8576811,"Neonates need arachidonic acid (AA) for their growing tissues, but it is unknown to what extent they can synthesize AA from dietary linoleic acid (LA). We studied infantile AA synthesis by using different natural 13C amounts in dietary fats. The diets of four infants ages 18 +/- 4 days (mean +/- SD) with newly diagnosed phenylketonuria were changed from breast milk or formula to a phenylalanine-free diet with corn oil as the only fat source. Compared with most dietary fats in Europe derived from C3 plants, corn oil LA has a higher 13C content. We determined the 13C content of LA and AA in 0.25-0.5 ml serum before and for 3-4 days after the diet change with gas chromatography combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS). Baseline delta 13C values were -31.5 +/- 1.1% (mean +/- SD) for serum LA and -30.1 +/- 1.2% for AA. The corn oil diet induced changes of delta 13C values over baseline in LA of 8.9 +/- 1.0 on day 1 and 12.7 +/- 0.7 on day 4, respectively. The changes of AA delta 13C values were 0.5 +/- 0.7 and 2.7 +/- 0.7 on days 1 and 4. We conclude that reproducible detection of differences in delta 13C values of fatty acids in small samples of infantile serum, induced by dietary variation of natural 13C amounts, is feasible with GC-IRMS.

The protein obtained corresponded to sIgA antibodies according to all known criteria and did not contain any protein contaminations. The ability of sIgA to phosphorylate selectively serine residues of casein (not histones) in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP was shown. Purified kinase activity was stable at acid shock (pH 2.3), strongly interacted with immobilized antibodies against H-chain of sIgA and eluted from the sorbent with the peak corresponding to sIgA antibodies. The complex of sIgA and ATP was stable enough at the conditions of gel-filtration. Affinity modification of sIgA by chemically reactive analogs of ATP resulted in preferential modification of its light chain (2-3 mole reagent per mole of dimer form). In the condition of oligomer dissociation ATP-sepharose sorbed only the light chains of sIgA. sIgA have optimal conditions for phosphorylating activity different from those of known protein kinases. We suppose that sIgA antibodies with kinase activity are a first example of sIgA antibodies with catalytic activity.

7673513,"Bovine cheese whey was investigated as a source of growth-stimulating factors that might replace or supplement fetal bovine serum in cell culture. Although some cell growth activity was demonstrated in whey or whey ultrafiltrates, enrichment on the basis of molecular size was not useful because the most abundant whey proteins, beta-lactoglobulin and alpha-lactalbumin, have molecular masses that are similar to most known growth factors. Instead, cation-exchange chromatography was selected as an enrichment process because, in contrast to the major whey proteins, growth factors generally have basic isoelectric points. Adsorption to and elution from Sepharose Fast Flow-S resin yielded an extract containing only 1 to 2% of whey protein but substantial growth-promoting activities on Balb/c 3T3 cells, L6 myoblasts, and human skin fibroblasts. The growth activity could be separated from lactoferrin, one of the prominent basic proteins present, through a stepwise elution from the resin. The resultant fraction, which contained lactoperoxidase as the most abundant protein stimulated the growth of the three cell lines at protein concentrations that were 2- to 20-fold lower than observed with fetal bovine serum. Immunoglobulin G could be removed by affinity chromatography, or lactoperoxidase could be inactivated by heat, without significant losses to the growth-promoting capacity of the fraction.

7737181,"Human milk bile-salt-stimulated lipase ensures efficient utilization of milk lipid in breast-fed infants. The N-terminal two-thirds of the peptide chain is highly conserved and shows striking similarities to typical esterases. In contrast, the remaining C-terminal part consists of a unique sequence of 16 proline-rich O-glycosylated repeats of 11 residues each. Recently we could show, using recombinant lipase variants, that neither these repeats nor the single N-linked sugar chain are essential for catalytic efficiency. In the present study, we report on the lack of importance of glycosylation and the unique repeats for other important functional properties, i.e. bile-salt activation, heparin binding, heat stability, stability at low pH and resistance to proteolytic inactivation. Compared to native enzyme, recombinant full-length lipase produced in two mammalian cell lines differed slightly in glycosylation pattern with no effects on the functional properties. Moreover, a variant lacking all repeats and the C-terminal tail following the last repeat exhibited the same functional characteristics as purified native milk enzyme. Thus, the structural basis for all the typical and functionally important properties reside in the N-terminal conserved part, in spite of the fact that none of these properties are shared by typical esterases.

However, the development of ion-exchange and reverse-phase HPLC methods for the purification and quantitation of the kappa- and beta-caseins, along with tritium labeling of the carbohydrate of the kappa-casein in human milk to aid in its detection, provided the tools for probing micelle structure by examining the composition of micelles fractionated according to size by differential centrifugation. The relative amount of kappa-casein increased as micelle size decreased, and thus as surface area/volume increased. Since kappa-casein also stabilizes the micelles against precipitation by Ca2+ ions, a surface position for most of the kappa-casein is implied. The relative amounts of the various phosphorylation levels of the human beta-caseins remained essentially constant except for the nonphosphorylated (O-P) form, which apparently decreased as micelle size decreased. These data suggest that the beta-caseins are linked in the micelles partially through electrostatic interactions involving the organic phosphoryl groups, lacking in the O-P, so that O-P can dissociate into the whey.

This value greatly exceeds the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated dose which would lead to one excess cancer per one million people of 0.006 pg of TCDD per kg of body weight per day over a seventy year lifetime or similar reference doses used by some other countries of up to 10/pg/kg/day over a 70 year lifetime.",Chemosphere,"['D000328', 'D000818', 'D001572', 'D002170', 'D003611', 'D004147', 'D005060', 'D005399', 'D005506', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D007223', 'D008460', 'D000072317', 'D014481']","['Adult', 'Animals', 'Benzofurans', 'Canada', 'Dairy Products', 'Dioxins', 'Europe', 'Fishes', 'Food Contamination', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Meat', 'Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins', 'United States']",Dioxins in U.S. food and estimated daily intake.,"[None, None, 'Q000008', None, None, 'Q000008', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000008', None]","[None, None, 'administration & dosage', None, None, 'administration & dosage', None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'administration & dosage', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7850373,1995,0
7818287,"Blood samples were collected from 28 mothers and from 38 school-aged children from Michigan farms on which there were polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated silos. The samples were analyzed for PCBs and other contaminants, including polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (p,p'-DDT + p,p'-DDE) via packed column gas chromatography. The PCBs were quantified, using the Webb-McCall method, with Aroclors 1016 and 1260 used as reference standards. Approximately 42% of the children had serum PCB levels above the detection limit of 3.0 ng/ml. The values ranged from 3.1 to 23.3 ng/ml, with a mean of 6.8 ng/ml. In contrast, PCBs were detected in 86% of the mothers. The mean serum concentration was somewhat higher for the mothers (9.6 ng/ml), but the range was similar to that found for the children. PBBs were not detected in any of the children, but were present in trace amounts in 25% of the mothers. Conversely, DDT was present in 66% of the children and 93% of the mothers. As with PCBs, DDT concentrations were somewhat higher in the mothers. DDE accounted for 89% of the total DDT in serum. Various potential sources of exposure were evaluated as possible determinants of serum PCB levels, using hierarchical multiple regression. Years of residence on a silo farm and consumption of PCB-contaminated Great Lakes fish both accounted for significant portions of the variance in maternal serum PCB levels. Exposure via breast-feeding explained a large and highly significant proportion of the variance in the children's serum PCB concentrations, suggesting that breast milk was the primary source of PCB exposure for these children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Archives of environmental health,"['D000293', 'D000328', 'D000383', 'D000818', 'D002648', 'D004032', 'D004781', 'D005260', 'D005399', 'D005506', 'D006801', 'D008824', 'D008875', 'D008895', 'D009035', 'D011078', 'D012044']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agriculture', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Diet', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Fishes', 'Food Contamination', 'Humans', 'Michigan', 'Middle Aged', 'Milk, Human', 'Mothers', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Regression Analysis']",Determinants of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the sera of mothers and children from Michigan farms with PCB-contaminated silos.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000097', None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'blood', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7818287,1995,0
7980396,"An inhibitor of pancreatic elastase (EI), which can also inhibit chymotrypsin, and an inhibitor of trypsin (TI), which can also inhibit plasmin, have been isolated from bovine plasma. EI and TI belong to the serpin family of inhibitors. The size of both inhibitors is approx. 60 kDa and they are able to form SDS-stable complexes with proteinases. Curiously, TI dimerizes in the presence of SDS, a feature which has been observed previously only in non-denaturing gels of human alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1PI). EI and TI are glycosylated [16% and 19% (w/w) respectively] and their amino acid compositions are similar to those of other plasma serpins. Neither EI nor TI is the equivalent of bovine alpha 1PI, as revealed by partial sequence analysis of their N-termini and reactive sites. Rather, both inhibitors appear to be related to human alpha 1-antichymotrypsin. Inhibition of pancreatic elastase and chymotrypsin by EI occurs with a kass. approximately 10(5) M-1.s-1. TI inhibits trypsin with a kass. approximately 10(5) M-1.s-1. Plasmin is inhibited by TI with a kass. approximately 10(3) M-1.s-1. The values of the kinetic constants are similar to those determined for the well-studied human serpins. Antibodies to EI and TI reveal a set of four antigenically related proteins of similar size in plasma. In addition, they detect the same set of proteins in milk.

7841620,"The composition of modern infant formulae is basically oriented on the ""golden standard"" human milk and influenced by several official regulations and recommendations (EC, ESPGAN, etc.). This article will focus on two recent improvements in the field of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPs) and protein hydrolysates. The addition of LCPs for preterm formulae was recommended recently by ESPGAN (the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition). Our research has focused on this problem for many years and we have found a good source of LCPs using specially prepared egg-yolk lipids. Others have used fish oils and run into the problem of growth retardation. Therefore, the possible sources of LCPs have to be discussed very critically and the alternatives will be shown. Also, new developments like the use of single-cell oils will be discussed. Second, the use of protein hydrolysates have been introduced for the so-called hypoantigenic or hypoallergenic formulae. Hypoantigenic formulae for preventive use have to be differentiated clearly from hypoallergenic formulae for treatment of proved cows' milk protein allergy. The problems of designing suitable hydrolysates that are low in antigenicity and good in taste will be outlined. The determination of the molecular weight distribution by gel chromatography will be compared critically with the newer techniques. The ELISA technique for testing the antigenicity is recommended before any in vivo evaluation. So far, the anaphylactic guinea-pig model is the most sensitive in vivo testing method.

This method showed satisfactory results on the linearity of standard curves and their productibility, and a correlation was obtained between those obtained by the traditional method and by our simple method in human milk. We employed this method for the analysis of human milk secreted between the 3rd day and the 42nd day after delivery.

By contrast, none of the molecular species tested was able to inhibit the attachment of Actinomyces viscosus Ny 1 to S-HA. On the other hand, casein derivatives were shown to displace human serum albumin from S-HA beads. They were also able to bind to the bacterial cell surface of all strains examined.

8206972,"Adipose tissue contains substantial stores of retinoid (retinol+retinyl ester) that, quantitatively, are second only to retinoid stores in the liver. Our studies show that retinoid levels in adipose tissue are markedly influenced by dietary retinoid intake. Because lipoprotein lipase (LPL) increases the uptake of lipoproteins and lipid emulsion particles by many cell types including adipocytes, we investigated whether LPL also increases retinoid uptake by adipocytes from lipid-containing particles. Addition of LPL (10 micrograms/ml) to BFC-1 beta adipocytes produced a 2-fold increase in cellular uptake of [3H]retinoid from a lipid emulsion containing [3H]retinyl ester. Heparin, which displaces LPL from binding sites on cell surface proteoglycans, increased [3H]retinoid uptake by an additional 2-fold. High performance liquid chromatography analyses showed that greater than 75% of the media and 85% of the cellular radioactivity was present as retinol. The conversion of retinyl ester to retinol by LPL was then assessed using model retinyl ester containing lipid emulsions. Although triglyceride appears to be the preferred substrate for LPL, after greater than 25% of the triglyceride was hydrolyzed, significant amounts of retinyl ester were hydrolyzed by LPL. Retinyl ester hydrolysis was increased approximately 20-fold in the presence of a source of apolipoprotein C-II. The physiologically significant palmitate, stearate, oleate, and linoleate esters of retinol were all hydrolyzed by LPL. When LPL was incubated with [3H]retinyl ester containing rabbit mesenteric chylomicrons and in the presence of heparin and apolipoprotein C-II, the LPL was able to completely hydrolyze the retinyl ester to retinol. Thus, LPL is able to catalyze the hydrolysis of retinyl esters and, through the process of hydrolysis, may facilitate uptake of retinoid by adipocytes.",The Journal of biological chemistry,"['D017667', 'D000273', 'D000818', 'D001692', 'D002417', 'D002460', 'D002914', 'D004952', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D006868', 'D008071', 'D008077', 'D008099', 'D008297', 'D008892', 'D051381', 'D012176', 'D013379', 'D014801']","['Adipocytes', 'Adipose Tissue', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Chylomicrons', 'Esters', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Lipoprotein Lipase', 'Lipoproteins, LDL', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Milk', 'Rats', 'Retinoids', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Vitamin A']",Lipoprotein lipase hydrolysis of retinyl ester.

This was achieved by using regulatory elements from either the murine whey acidic protein gene or the ovine beta-lactoglobulin gene to control expression of human extracellular superoxide dismutase cDNA. Whey acidic protein regulatory sequences directed high level mammary gland-specific expression of the recombinant gene and secretion of biologically active extracellular superoxide dismutase into the milk. The produced recombinant protein was fully active, it was in tetrameric form, it showed heparin affinity, and its mass was similar to that of the native enzyme.

8165045,"Nutrient effects on cholesterol fractional synthesis rates (FSR) in infancy by stable isotope determination have not been studied. We hypothesized that FSR is significantly reduced with high dietary cholesterol and phytoestrogen intake and increased with low dietary cholesterol and phytoestrogen intake. We prospectively studied 33 term male infants exclusively fed human milk (high cholesterol, low phytoestrogen, n = 12), cow milk-based formula (low cholesterol, low phytoestrogen, n = 8), soy milk-based formula (zero cholesterol, high phytoestrogen, n = 7), or soy milk-based formula modified to contain cholesterol (low cholesterol, high phytoestrogen, n = 6) during the first 4 mo of life. Cholesterol FSR was determined from rate of incorporation of deuterium into erythrocyte membrane cholesterol, and urinary isoflavone excretion (an index of dietary phytoestrogen exposure) was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Significant differences in cholesterol FSR were found. FSR (%/d) was lowest in human milk (2.62 +/- 0.38), highest in soy milk-based formula (9.40 +/- 0.51), and intermediate in cow milk-based and modified soy milk-based formula (6.90 +/- 0.48 and 8.03 +/- 0.28, respectively), p < 0.0001. Cholesterol FSR was significantly lower in modified soy milk-based compared with soy milk-based formula, p < 0.05. We also show for the first time that dietary phytoestrogens are absorbed and excreted by the infant fed soy protein-based formula. Urinary isoflavone excretion was inversely related to cholesterol FSR, but it was not significantly related to serum cholesterol concentration.

Eight infants were breast-fed, four were fed formulas that were based on adapted cow's milk, and five were fed a formula that was based on soy protein isolate. The formulas had higher protein concentrations than human milk; had different types of proteins, and had not been supplemented with taurine. Urinary bile acids were determined by gas-liquid chromatographic/mass spectrometric analyses of 24-h urinary samples collected at 1-12 days (only formula-fed infants) and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age. The results showed a higher urinary bile acid excretion at 3 months of age in both formula groups than in the breast-fed infants. A deficiency of dietary taurine during formula-feeding did not seem to limit the formation of taurine conjugates during the first month of life. The developmental pattern of urinary bile acid excretion during the first year differed according to the type of feeding. Isomers of cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid appeared in the urine of all breast-fed infants at 6 to 12 months of age. These metabolites, assumed to be the first metabolites derived from the developing gut flora of the infants, appeared at an earlier age and in higher amounts in both formula groups compared to breast-fed infants.

No relationship could be established between primary structure and function of transferrin glycans.

8155984,"ICP-MS is a powerful analytical technique for the determination of trace and ultra-trace elements in biological materials. Results are given of the analysis of human serum and of several biological reference materials (bovine liver, milk powder, wheat flour and pig kidney). Because concentrations of many trace metals of interest in these materials are low, dilution should be kept as limited as possible, although concentrations of certain concomitant elements (e.g. Na, K) can be high enough to cause significant suppression or enhancement of the ion signal. The result is that the dissolution procedure becomes a critical step in the analysis. Microwave digestion, wet digestion with several acids (HNO3, HClO4, HF) and simple dilution are compared with each other. In addition, three possible approaches to overcome these problems are discussed, namely the internal standardization method, the standard addition method and the isotope dilution method. Furthermore, ICP-MS is also more susceptible than initially expected to isobaric interferences arising from the plasma, the acids used in the sample preparation or the sample itself. These interferences are generally less important above a mass number of 80. Nevertheless, several researchers have investigated the possibility of removing the trace metals from the matrix or of using correction formulae based on the isotopic abundances of the elements. Some of these are evaluated. The need for identifying and quantifying chemical species, not just the elements, is well recognized. One of the reasons why elemental determination may not suffice is that different species of the same element may have a different chemical and toxicological behaviour.

8214605,"A method for the determination of the total iodine content in milk powder and human serum by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry is described. It is shown that the oxidation state of the analyte has a strong impact on the analytical performance. If iodine is present as iodide and nitric acid is used for acidification, the observed ion signal is not stable and samples spiked with iodide yield erroneous recoveries up to 750%. Hence, as the iodine in milk powder is present almost exclusively as iodide, destruction of the sample with nitric acid is not suitable. It was found that such an excessive spike recovery does not occur if ammonia solution instead of nitric acid is used as the diluent. The proposed sample preparation was tested by analysing three reference milk powders, namely Certified Reference Materials 150 and 151 Spiked Skim Milk Powder (from the Community Bureau of Reference) and Standard Reference Material 1549 Non-Fat Milk Powder (from the National Institute of Standards and Technology).

The objectives of the study were: 1) To detect the levels of OCC in the different samples. 2) To discover the difference in levels between breast and bottle fed babies. 3) To quantify the variations of the levels in the different samples. 4) To check whether the acceptable daily intake (ADI) established for these OCC is exceeded among these babies. The analyses were done in the National Institute of Toxicology in Seville, by using the following methods, gas chromatography, electron capture detector and mass spectrometry. The statistical analysis was based on the Kruskal-Wallis, Shapiro-Wilks, Levene, Pooled and Separate tests. We have found significant levels of OCC in the samples analyzed. The PCBs are the compounds in our study which have the highest levels, indeed being one of the highest levels documented to date.

Almost all of the woman had lived their entire lives in total isolation, except for an occasional visit to Tabubil, a town between 5-5 days walking distance. The people in these villages grow their own food and practice primitive agricultural techniques (i.e., hunter gatherer/slash and burn).  Gas chromatography tests were used to detect levels of organochlorine residues.  DDT was present in all breast milk samples.  In fact, the breast milk of 10 women had DDT levels higher than the allowable limit of 1.25/mg/kg fat for cow's milk (1.43-300 mg/kg).  Mean total DDT levels were considerably higher in the breast milk of mothers feeding their first child than it was in mothers feeding their second or higher birth order child (1.33 mg/kg vs. .6 mg/kg; p  .001).  Younger mothers ( 30 years) had higher mean total DDT/levels than did older mothers (.96 mg/kg vs. .63;l p  .05).  6 mothers had Heptachlor epoxide in their breast milk (.01-.02 mg/kg), but the levels were below the maximum residual concentration of .15 mg/kg fat.  These same mothers all had higher than average DDT levels.  They did not come from the same village.  It is important to note that no spraying of DDT had occurred in or near any of the villages. 11 women had higher DDT levels than DDE levels, suggesting recent and/or direct exposure, but the researchers could not explain why these women had higher DDT levels.

Molecular-sieve chromatography of human colostral whey and serum and subsequent assay of beta-1,4-GT activity have shown that beta-1,4-GT was present as a free enzyme (55 kDa) and associated with components of larger molar mass. The elution pattern did not change when the chromatography was carried out in a buffer devoid of, or enriched with, Mn2+, a cofactor of beta-1,4-GT activity. However, the activity associated with the large molar mass components was absent when the chromatography was carried out in the presence of a chelating agent (EDTA). Analyses of the eluted material by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE), and by immunodiffusion indicated that the major colostral component in beta-1,4-GT activity-containing fractions was secretory IgA (S-IgA); in addition, the beta-1,4-GT activity was detected in fractions that contained lactoferrin and alpha-lactalbumin. Interactions of beta-1,4-GT with S-IgA and lactoferrin in colostrum were also demonstrated by the detection of radioactivity in precipitin lines obtained by immunoelectrophoresis and autoradiography of the colostral whey after it had been incubated with UDP-[3H]-galactose. Furthermore, radioactively labeled S-IgA and alpha-chain were detected when colostral whey incubated with UDP-[3H]-galactose was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and reducing conditions, respectively. In serum, the beta-1,4-GT-binding components identified in fractions after molecular-sieve chromatography were IgG, IgA, IgM and transferrin. The binding of beta-1,4-GT to immunoglobulins (Ig) was also demonstrated by assaying the beta-1,4-GT activity associated with Sepharose-4B-immobilized Ig of various isotypes and molecular forms, which were incubated with colostral beta-1,4-GT in the presence of Mn2+. Beta-1,4-GT measured by enzyme activity was bound to these Ig in order: polymeric IgA2 > monomeric IgA1 = polymeric IgA1 = secretory IgA = pentameric IgM > IgG. Immobilized component chains, namely alpha, mu and J chains, bound beta-1,4-GT more effectively than native Ig.

The beta(1----4)galactosyltransferase was shown, by PAGE analysis, to transfer a beta-galactosyl residue to the AGA conjugate of beta-D-GlcNAc-(1----4)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1----4)-D-GlcNAc (compound 4). Similarly, alpha(1----2)fucosyltransferase isolated from porcine submaxillary glands was shown to transfer fucose from GDP-fucose to the AGA conjugate of beta-D-Gal-(1----4)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1----6)-D-Gal (compound 5). This conjugate (compound 5) was also an acceptor for the alpha(1----3/4)fucosyltransferase partially purified from human milk.

S-fimbriae are a common property of E. coli strains causing sepsis and meningitis in neonates. Meconium had the highest content of neuraminic acid and the strongest inhibitory effect on bacterial adhesion. HMF also exerted high inhibitory activity while FF was markedly less active: To achieve inhibitory effects comparable to HMF a sixfold amount of FF was required. Glycoproteins from excretions were separated by gel chromatography. Fractions obtained were analyzed for adhesion-inhibiting activity. In all excretions analyzed, the mucin-containing fraction could be identified as the major inhibitory component. Inhibition was probably mediated by specific interaction of this fraction with S-fimbriae, as shown by binding of isolated fimbriae on Western blots after electrophoretic separation of glycoproteins.

The zinc content of the meal was 22 mumol. The absorption of zinc (65Zn) from white bread with no detectable phytate content was 43.3 +/- 17.9% (mean +/- SD) and from the breads with added 400 mumol of IP-6: 14.3 +/- 3.2%; 200 mumol of IP-5: 27.1 +/- 5.3%; 400 mumol of IP-5: 18.1 +/- 4.2%; and 400 mumol of IP-4: 41.5 +/- 11.3%. The results indicate that IP-6 and IP-5 have zinc-absorption depressing properties, while IP-4 added in isolated form is relatively inert as regards zinc absorption.

This automated, microanalytical technique requires 50 microliters of biological matrix, which is subjected to an isopropanol extraction. Chromatography was accomplished using a microbore HPLC system, a reversed-phase C18 column and a mobile phase of 0.3% triethylamine in water (pH 5.1). Cefpirome and the internal standard (beta-hydroxypropyltheophylline) were monitored using UV detection at 240 nm and had retention times of 2.84 and 5.05 min, respectively. The method was linear up to 500 mg/l for both matrices and had a limit of detection of 0.6 mg/l. The interday variation (relative standard deviation) at concentrations of 5.0, 50.0 and 500.0 mg/l was consistently less than 5% in both urine and breast milk. The method was found to be free from interference by other commonly administered medications and readily adaptable for use in clinical investigations.

Both methods yielded similar results: casein synthesis is low or absent in early lactation, then increases rapidly and subsequently decreases.

These changes result in a whey protein/casein ratio of about 90:10 in early lactation, 60:40 in mature milk and 50:50 in late lactation.

The fatty share was rejected, the remaining two fractions were further separated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) as described in (1), and analyzed for zinc (Zn). The HPLC-method was checked for stability of organo-metal complexes. Only bi-distilled water served as mobile phase during HPLC in order to maintain the Zn/organic molecule-complex intact and to avoid unnecessary contamination sources. Among milk proteins, zinc was associated with casein, albumin, lactoferrin, and metallothionein, whereas among LMW substances a zinc peak could be observed exclusively with citrate. The identity of citrate and proteins was verified with comparable HPLC runs of standard solutions, by citrate-specific examination of HPLC fractions and by isoelectric focusing (IEF) of collected HPLC fractions. Furthermore, native human milk, as well as fractions of proteins and LMW substances (with and without HPLC separation), were quantified with regard to total content of zinc, protein and citrate. No loss of substances was found. In human milk, zinc is primarily bound to citrate (approximately 3200 micrograms/L of Zn in pooled human milk = 95%), and only about 5% of the total amount of zinc is attached to proteins (approximately 150 micrograms/L of Zn in pooled human milk).

Although the retention times generally increased with increasing oligosaccharide chain length, linkage of Fuc alpha-(1----2) to galactose and by Fuc alpha-(1----3) or Fuc alpha-(1----4) to glcNAc may decrease the retention times of both the alditols and the reducing oligosaccharides. Branching generally increased the retention times for oligosaccharide alditols. The retention times of isomers differing in the position of fucose substitution (LNF-1 vs LNF-2) differed greatly while those of the linkage isomers LNF-2 and LNF-3 were similar but distinct. Pulsed amperometric detection is sensitive at the picomole level both for these underivatized oligosaccharides and alditols.

1954225,"The lipolysis of rat chylomicron polyenoic fatty acid esters with bovine milk lipoprotein lipase and human hepatic lipase was examined in vitro. Chylomicrons obtained after feeding fish oil or soy bean oil emulsions were used as substrates. The lipolysis was followed by gas chromatography or by using chylomicrons containing radioactive fatty acids. Lipoprotein lipase hydrolyzed eicosapentaenoic (20:5) and arachidonic acid (20:4) esters at a slower rate than the C14-C18 acid esters. More 20:5 and 20:4 thus accumulated in remaining tri- and diacylglycerols. Eicosatrienoic, docosatrienoic and docosahexanoic acids exhibited an intermediate lipolysis pattern. When added together with lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase increased the rate of lipolysis of 20:5 and 20:4 esters of both tri- and diacylglycerols. Addition of NaCl (final concentration 1 M) during the course of lipolysis inhibited lipoprotein lipase as well as the enhancing effect of hepatic lipase on triacylglycerol lipolysis. Hepatic lipase however, hydrolyzed diacylglycerol that had already been formed. Chylomicron 20:4 and 20:5 esters thus exhibit a relative resistance to lipoprotein lipase. It is suggested that the tri- and diacylglycerol species containing these fatty acids may accumulate at the surface of the remnant particles and act as substrate for hepatic lipase during a concerted action of this enzyme and lipoprotein lipase.",Biochimica et biophysica acta,"['D000818', 'D002914', 'D005227', 'D005395', 'D005989', 'D066298', 'D008049', 'D008066', 'D008071', 'D008099', 'D008297', 'D051381', 'D011919']","['Animals', 'Chylomicrons', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fish Oils', 'Glycerides', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lipase', 'Lipolysis', 'Lipoprotein Lipase', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",Hydrolysis of chylomicron polyenoic fatty acid esters with lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase.,"[None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000378', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000494', None, 'Q000494', 'Q000201', None, None, None]","[None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'metabolism', 'analysis', None, 'pharmacology', None, 'pharmacology', 'enzymology', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1954225,1991,0

HPLC-purified sheep milk somatostatin was found to inhibit both basal and prostaglandin-induced release of growth hormone from cultured rat pituitary cells. The effect was dose-dependent and similar to that of synthetic SS. In order to determine whether SS or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) can be synthesized by the mammary gland we have looked for SS and VIP messenger RNA in rat glands extracted on different days of lactation. No messages for SS or VIP were detected in the mammary gland, whereas, as expected, hybridization signals for alpha-casein were evident. These results suggest that somatostatin and VIP are not synthesized by the mammary gland and are probably concentrated from blood. In other experiments we have demonstrated that one hour after oral administration of labelled somatostatin to rat pups, about 95% of the neuropeptide, extracted from the stomach, is eluted exactly at the same position as the marker peptide.

Formula milk labelled with exponentially decreasing doses of deuterium oxide represented milk from a 'pseudo mother' of these exclusively bottle-fed infants. Unlabelled formula represented milk from other sources. Deuterium levels in the infants' body water were measured on saliva samples by mass spectroscopy. The data were fitted in a two-compartment steady-state model of the mother-child system to estimate the flow of labelled water from the 'mother' to the infant and the 'mother' and infant's water elimination constants. A dose-to-child experiment was also carried out on each infant to determine the deuterium dilution space and total daily water intake. Total and labelled water flows from deuterium dilution were used to calculate total, labelled and unlabelled formula milk intakes which were compared to the same quantities measured by bottle weighing. Water elimination constants calculated from the dose-to-mother experiments underestimated by 17 per cent the initially set mother constant and overestimated by 21 per cent the infant constants calculated from the dose-to-child experiments. Rate constants, however, have little effect on the estimated water flows so that there was good agreement between values from deuterium dilution and from direct weighing. Mean (SD) total formula, labelled formula and unlabelled formula intakes were 865 (129) g/d, 417 (74) g/d and 448 (106) g/d, respectively, when measured by deuterium dilution, compared with 856 (116) g/d, 414 (71) g/d and 441 (68) g/d when measured by direct weighing.

1706194,"Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 83D4 was generated using formol-fixed paraffin-embedded human breast carcinoma tissue as the immunogen. Previous studies demonstrated that it was reactive with breast carcinoma tissues, but not with normal breast. The antigen identified by mAb 83D4 was detected, using ELISA, in MCF7 breast carcinoma cell line membrane extracts, in primary breast and colon carcinoma tissue extracts and in pleural effusion fluid from patients with metastatic breast cancer. No reactivity with 83D4 was found in either human milk fat globule membranes or skimmed milk. 83D4 reactive antigen was found to be a heterogeneous high molecular weight (MW) protein (apparent Mr:300-400 to over 1000 kDa) by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting. The antigen was purified from MCF7 cells, breast and colon carcinomas and effusion fluid, by perchloric acid solubilisation followed by immunoaffinity chromatography with 83D4. The immunopurified antigen from MCF7 cells and pleural effusion fluid was further analysed by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography, which confirmed the high MW and indicated the charge heterogeneity of the reactive molecules. The 83D4 reactive antigen strongly bound to wheat-germ agglutinin and weakly to peanut lectin. No binding was found with lentil lectin or concanavalin A. Antigenic activity was strongly reduced by trypsin and subtilysin digestion and by treatment with sodium periodate, but it was not affected by neuraminidase. These results imply the glycoprotein nature of the 83D4-defined antigen and the involvement of carbohydrate, but probably not sialic acid, in the epitope. Purified 83D4 antigen did not display reactivity for mAb HMFG-1, directed against a polymorphic epithelial mucin, PEM, using ELISA, but bound mAb CC49 and weakly mAb B72.3, antibodies which define a tumour associated glycoprotein, TAG-72. Moreover CC49 and 83D4 showed similar reactivity pattern in immunoblotting assays. A double determinant radioimmunoassay confirmed that 83D4 antigen carries epitopes for mAb B72.3 and CC49. Competition radioimmunoassays clearly distinguished the 83D4 defined epitope from those recognised by B72.3 and CC49, demonstrating that antibody 83D4 identifies a unique epitope.

It has been revealed that melittin binds to the apo- and acidic states of alpha-lactalbumin while the presence of Ca2+ makes the interaction essentially weaker. The association constant for the complex of melittin with apo-alpha-lactalbumin determined from spectropolarimetric melittin-titration data is 2 X 10(7) M-1. The complexation of alpha-lactalbumin with melittin decreases its affinity to Ca2+ by three orders of magnitude. The interaction of apo-alpha-lactalbumin with melittin causes some changes in the environment of its aromatic amino acid residues and drastically alters the conformation of melittin, increasing its alpha-helical content but leaving its single tryptophan residue accessible to water.

In addition, the activity of bile salt-dependent lipase (esterase), which may play an important role in the newborn infant's lipids digestion, was measured. After the first month postpartum, independent of the nutritional state of the mother, sugar and protein concentrations were identical. Lipid content of French mothers' milk was lower in transitional milk, but appeared constant in mature milk with an average value of 29.1 +/- 5.8 mg/mL of milk. In Zaïrian mothers' milk, the lipid content of mature milk plateaued at around 50-55 mg/mL independent of the stage of lactation. Bile salt-dependent lipase showed constant esterase activity within the lactation stage in privileged mothers' milk, but decreased by almost 80-90% during the first four months of lactation in undernourished mothers.

2067565,"Consumption of trans-fatty acids increased markedly during this century due to the widespread use of partially hydrogenated fats. A sensitive analytical method was developed which enables the precise determination of 7 trans-isomers in small sample volumes. With this method we documented the materno-fetal transfer of trans-fatty acids across the human placenta. The content in human milk depends on maternal diet and is lower in Germany than in the Sudan. The distribution in fore- and hind-milk, in milk fat fractions and within the triglyceride molecule was determined. The content of trans-fatty acids is lower in commercial and home-made infant formulae than in human milk, although there is a certain batch to batch variation in formulae. Infants absorb dietary trans-isomers and incorporate them into endogenous lipids, subcutaneous tissue and cell membranes. Trans-fatty acids in plasma lipids are significantly higher in infants fed human milk than in those fed formulae. African children have a lower exposure than Germans. The relative contribution of trans-octadecenoic acid is lower in plasma sterol esters than in triglycerides and phospholipids, pointing to a negative selectivity of plasmatic cholesterol esterification with this fatty acid. Thus, a high supply of trans-octadecenoic acid might have negative effects on the cholesterol levels. In premature infants we found an inverse correlation between trans-fatty acid exposure and birthweight, thus interference with intrauterine growth appears possible. A possible causative factor could be impaired biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids by trans-isomers, for which we found strong indications.

Twenty drugs were selected from different pharmacological groups (beta-blocking agents, antidepressants, anxiolytic sedatives and neuroleptics, antihistamines, alkaloids and an anthelmintic) and subjected to a general solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure described earlier for plasma samples. This SPE method was developed on a cyanopropyl cartridge and consisted of a conditioning step with methanol and water, the adsorption of the deproteinized matrix, washing with water and/or methanol, and finally the elution of the basic compounds with 0.1% propylamine in methanol. The extracts were further analysed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC). The application of SPE to human milk samples utilized cyanopropyl and octadecyl cartridges. The latter can be applied more generally because it better retains the basic compounds. For 14 out of 17 drugs extracted from breast milk, recoveries of greater than 70% were obtained. Standard deviations were, with the exception of three drugs, in the same range as those observed for plasma samples, i.e. 2-8%. The development of a strategy for SPE of drugs from human milk was difficult. For a number of drugs, in particular those present in human milk at low concentrations and/or detected in a non-selective way, matrix compounds interfered with the subsequent LC analysis. Therefore, SPE on CN or C18-sorbent for the analysis of basic compounds in breast milk was found to be useful as one of the steps in an extraction procedure, but not as a single technique.

An electrophoretic analysis of whey protein from cynomolgus monkey milk revealed that its constituents are more similar to bovine milk than human milk, i.e. cynomolgus monkey milk whey contains, besides alpha-lactalbumin-like protein (LaP), another predominant component similar to bovine beta-lactoglobulin (LgP), in its electrophoretic behavior on both disc- and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses. 2. The amino acid composition of LaP shows close similarity to that of human alpha-lactalbumin, and LaP forms an immunoprecipitin line with anti-human alpha-lactalbumin rabbit antiserum. The homology between LaP and alpha-lactalbumin was further confirmed by an analysis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence. 3. LgP is not immunologically identical to bovine beta-lactoglobulin, but its amino acid composition is similar. The result of the N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of LgP (up to the 26th residue) strongly suggests homology between this protein and beta-lactoglobulin.","Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

After 38 wk on test, the treated and control rhesus monkeys were mated with untreated males. The clinical signs resulting from the Aroclor 1254 ingestion were similar for both species, and the time of onset after initiation of treatment was not appreciably different between the two species. Several treatment and interspecies differences were found with regard to the haematological and serum biochemistry parameters monitored, but age differences between the two species may have contributed to these findings. Periodic analysis of adipose tissue, blood and faecal specimens for PCBs suggested that the rhesus monkey retained more of the ingested PCB than did the cynomolgus monkey.

The birthweights (1076 +/- 301 g; 1031 +/- 309 g) and the gestational ages (28.4 +/- 1.6 weeks; 27.7 +/- 2.1 weeks) were comparable. The amount of protein added to the milk was set at 0.7 g/100 ml in order to provide a total supply of 3.0-3.5 g/kg/24 h. All infants received additional amounts of carbohydrate, calcium, phosphorous, and sodium chloride. Capillary whole blood amino acids were measured with high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The amino acid levels did not differ significantly when the feeding groups were compared week by week, but the glycine/valine ratio was higher (p less than 0.05) in the HMP group after three weeks of fortification. Longitudinal changes after protein enrichment could be demonstrated in both groups. Alanine and threonine increased after one week (p less than 0.01) in both groups. Glycine in the HMP group peaked after two weeks (p less than 0.02), and valine in the CMP group increased (p less than 0.02) after one week on the feeding regimen.

In addition, PTHrP produced in the fetal parathyroid glands and placenta may be responsible for stimulation of placental calcium transport. In the current study, we used a radioimmunoassay for human PTHrP to measure levels of the peptide in (1) human breast milk, cow's milk, and two infant formulas; (2) sequential plasma samples in prepartum and postpartum lactating women; (3) women with pathologic hyperprolactinemia; and (4) human umbilical cord blood. In normal subjects, plasma PTHrP levels ranged from less than 2 to 5 pmol/liter. In contrast, human breast milk contained substantially increased levels of immunoreactive PTHrP. Similar elevations were found in cow's milk and in one infant formula. Column chromatography of breast milk demonstrated that PTHrP immunoreactivity included a region of adenylate cyclase stimulating activity, consistent with the presence of biologically active PTHrP. Plasma prepartum PTHrP values did not differ from corresponding postpartum values in lactating women. Women with hyperprolactinemia had a mean plasma PTHrP value in the high-normal range. Umbilical cord blood had considerably suppressed parathyroid hormone values but PTHrP levels that were indistinguishable from those in normal human plasma. Thus, PTHrP is present in high concentrations in breast milk but apparently does not gain access to the maternal circulation in significant amounts.

We have recently developed a method to isolate casein from whey proteins in human milk and to separate the casein subunits by fast protein liquid chromatography. In this study we have applied this methodology to study the casein subunit pattern in preterm milk, colostrum, and mature milk. Casein concentration increased with lactation time, largely due to an increase in glycosylated forms of casein (kappa-caseins). Thus, the relative proportion of beta-casein to kappa-casein decreased during the lactation period. The patterns of phosphorylated and glycosylated casein subunits were found to vary during lactation, showing that both synthesis and posttranslational modification of beta- and kappa-casein are regulated by different mechanisms.",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,"['D000328', 'D002364', 'D003126', 'D004591', 'D005260', 'D006801', 'D007774', 'D008895', 'D011247', 'D013997']","['Adult', 'Caseins', 'Colostrum', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lactation', 'Milk, Human', 'Pregnancy', 'Time Factors']","Casein and casein subunits in preterm milk, colostrum, and mature human milk.","[None, 'Q000302', 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000502', 'Q000032', None, None]","[None, 'isolation & purification', 'analysis', None, None, None, 'physiology', 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2358977,1990,0
2340307,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is an important enzyme in lipid and energy metabolism of all vertebrates. Measurement of its activity in human postheparin plasma has become a standard procedure for diagnosis of Type I hyperlipoproteinemia and other types of hypertriglyceridemias. This paper presents a rapid and simple purification procedure for human lipoprotein lipase and the production of specific polyclonal antibodies. In the isolation procedure, the fat moiety of human milk obtained by centrifugation was delipidated and a buffer-extractable fraction chromatographed sequentially on heparin-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose. This three-step procedure provides a high yield of apparently pure LPL with very high specific activity against radiolabeled triacylglycerol substrates. The apparent molecular weight of LPL on SDS-PAGE was 60 kDa. Amino acid analysis and NH2-terminal sequencing proved the identity and the apparent homogeneity of the isolated enzyme. alpha-Lactoferrin and antithrombin III, common contaminants in earlier isolation procedures, were not detectable immunologically. Purified LPL was used to produce in the rabbit a specific polyclonal antiserum that inhibited LPL activity from human postheparin plasma and other tissues. In postheparin plasma from normal individuals, anti-LPL IgG was used in Western blotting to show LPL protein. In preheparin plasma, or in certain patients with Type I hyperlipoproteinemia, no specific signal was detected. The improved purification procedure presented here allows the rapid isolation of human LPL and production of antibodies to the protein, both of which will greatly facilitate future studies of this important enzyme.",Biochimica et biophysica acta,"['D000595', 'D000818', 'D000906', 'D015153', 'D002417', 'D002847', 'D004591', 'D006168', 'D006801', 'D008071', 'D051379', 'D008895', 'D008969', 'D011817']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, Agarose', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Lipoprotein Lipase', 'Mice', 'Milk, Human', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rabbits']",Rapid and simple isolation procedure for lipoprotein lipase from human milk.,"[None, None, 'Q000276', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000097', None, 'Q000201', None, None]","[None, None, 'immunology', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'blood', None, 'enzymology', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2340307,1990,0

2135955,"In view of the conflicting data on urinary Zn excretion in infancy we investigated the possible influence of contamination, collecting methods, nutrition (human milk versus formula) and longitudinal changes during the first 16 weeks of life. Methodical investigation showed that special attention is necessary to avoid contamination due to the use of Zn-containing baby creams in the genital region. The sampling device for collection should include the smallest area of skin possible and the use of Zn-containing baby creams has to be avoided both during the collection and at least 24 hours prior to urine collection. Previous fractional urine sampling of the collecting method to be evaluated proves that erroneously high values are not obtained at the beginning of collection. Midstream urinary samples reduce the possibility of contamination. Increased urinary excretion was shown in pre-term infants under theophylline or coffeine medication.

The two sets of milks both exhibited a dramatic decline in total zinc concentrations with increasing duration of lactation, in common with previous studies. However, the UK milks unexpectedly had lower zinc contents at all stages than the Gambian milks. Milk zinc levels were not significantly related to either maternal age or parity in the Gambian women. The proportion of zinc found in the sedimentable fraction remained nearly constant with increasing duration of lactation, but the proportion found in the fat fraction increased and the proportion in the whey fraction declined.

As part of an overall monitoring program, an investigation was undertaken with the following two aims: a) the present suitability of inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) to identify and quantitate minor and trace elements in human milk with the necessary accuracy and precision; b) assessment of RV concentrations for Al, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn.

2160840,"Using the dynamic fluorescence quenching method, it was shown that very low density (VLDL) apoproteins (apo B, E and C) tryptophanyls exhibit a lower accessibility towards water-soluble quenchers as compared to apo B LDL chromophores. The efficiency of proteolytic degradation by trypsin of VLDL-associated apo E and apo C was much lower than that of apo B. These results may be due to the cluster arrangement of amphipatic apo E and apo C on the VLDL surface and/or to their partial shielding by apo B. Treatment of VLDL particles with sub-lytic concentrations of the detergent, Tween-20, did not change the relaxation characteristics of amphipatic apoprotein tryptophanyl microenvironment, but resulted in a reversible structural transition registered by a ""red"" shift of the emission spectrum maximum as well as by change of the iodine quenching pattern. The detergent-induced increase of the VLDL tryptophanyl accessibility to acrylamide and the decrease of the quenching constant at the partial and complete particle solubilization were related to a change of the apo B molecular package. Treatment of VLDL with Tween-20 or cow milk lipoprotein lipase resulted in the appearance of tryptophanyl population that was not involved in the resonance energy transfer to the lipid phase-localized fluorescent probe pyrene, which is indicative of the protein dissociation. Treatment of VLDL particles with sub-lytic concentrations of Tween-20 revealed a lower (compared to apo C) relative affinity of apo E for the VLDL lipid surface. Inhibition of the lipoprotein lipase activity by apoprotein C-III was found to be non-competitive.

The procedure exploits the rapid, ionic-strength dependent, thiophilic adsorption of Ig during a single pass of colostral whey through a column of beaded agarose with immobilized thioether-sulfone ligands (Anal Biochem 1986;159:217-226). The purity and composition of the adsorbed Ig were verified by SDS-PAGE and sensitive silver-staining protein detection procedures; proteins of approximately 78-80 kD (secretory component), 50-60 kD (heavy chain), and 25 kD (light chain) were observed. The identity, structural integrity, and relative concentrations of the recovered Ig were confirmed by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography, Ouchterlony immunodiffusion, rocket immunoelectrophoresis and ELISA. These results were analyzed and compared with reported values for the concentration of human milk Ig.

However, the lipid content of most whole foods including brains, eggs, and liver is so low that prohibitively large amounts of food would be required to be fed to infants. It is concluded that it is virtually impossible to supplement the diet of formula-fed infants to match the long-chain PUFA intake of breast-fed infants with currently available whole foods.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,"['D001942', 'D004910', 'D005231', 'D006801', 'D007223', 'D007225', 'D007227', 'D008563', 'D008895', 'D009751']","['Breast Feeding', 'Erythrocyte Membrane', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Food', 'Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Milk, Human', 'Nutritional Requirements']",Weaning foods cannot replace breast milk as sources of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000032', None]","[None, 'metabolism', 'analysis', None, None, 'analysis', None, 'metabolism', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2816805,1989,0

Vitamin D2, D3, 25-OH-D2 and 25-OH-D3 were simultaneously determined by high performance liquid chromatography, and the determination of 24,25-(OH)2D and 1,25-(OH)2D was performed by competitive protein binding assay and radioreceptor assay, respectively, after separation of the D2 and D3 compounds. After healthy lactating mothers had received a daily oral dose of vitamin D2 (1,200 IU/d) for 4 wk, the concentrations of vitamin D2, D3 and the metabolites were determined in their plasma and milk. Although the plasma levels of 25-OH-D2 were significantly increased, the increase in milk was relatively small. On the other hand, the increase of vitamin D2 levels in milk was greater than that of 25-OH-D2 in milk after supplementation. The levels of 1,25-(OH)2D in milk was lower after 5 wk of lactation than after 1 wk of lactation, regardless of maternal vitamin D2 supplementation.

Results were compared with the composition of human milk. Fat contents of all commercial formulas were similar to human milk values and met current recommendations, but 2 home-made preparations were at the upper and lower limits of the recommended range. Milk formulas tended to contain higher percentages of saturated and lower ones of cis-monounsaturated and trans-isomeric fatty acids than human milk. Linoleic acid (C18:2n-6) content was similar to human milk in most products but deviated clearly from recommended values in 2 home-made mixtures. Alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3n-3) values were often low in formulas, resulting a high n-6/n-3-ratios. In contrast to human milk, all formulas contained only minor amounts of the physiologically important long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids with 20 and 22 carbon atoms. Some seasonal variation in the content of palmitic (C16:0), oleic (C18:1n-9), linoleic and trans-fatty acids was found when five arbitrarily selected adapted formulas were analysed repeatedly over one year. The composition of a home-made formula made from fresh cow's milk was markedly different in winter and in summer, when percentages of saturated and trans-fatty acids were higher and of linoleic acid were lower. We conclude that the composition of most commercial formulas is better suited to meet the lipid requirements of young infants than the home-made preparations investigated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Acta paediatrica Scandinavica,"['D004041', 'D005227', 'D005860', 'D007225', 'D008041', 'D009829', 'D010169']","['Dietary Fats', 'Fatty Acids', 'Germany, West', 'Infant Food', 'Linoleic Acids', 'Oleic Acids', 'Palmitic Acids']",Fat content and fatty acid composition of infant formulas.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2782065,1989,0

The overall lowest PCB residues of all food commodities were found in skim milk, lamb, margarine and soups. Among the dairy products the highest PCB isomer levels were found in cheese and butter. The sum of all PCB isomers in these two commodities gave residue levels on a wet basis of 2.0 and 3.4 ng/g respectively. In the meat, fish and poultry class the highest specific PCB isomer levels were found in fish, especially freshwater fish, which contained a total of 21.0 ng PCB/g fish. In addition 28 out of the 34 selected PCB isomers were present in freshwater fish. Residue levels in canned fish were the second highest of all food commodities. The observed total PCB residue levels were below the Canadian guidelines for fish, dairy products, poultry, eggs and beef.

2735412,"In the rat, as in many other mammals, the majority of milk Ca is associated with casein micelles. Because luminal proteolysis is immature in the suckling rat, we investigated the hypothesis that milk Ca remains in the macromolecular form as it traverses the stomach and upper small intestine. When intestinal contents of rat pups were examined 1 h after gavage with 45Ca-milk, 98% of the 45Ca was found to be in a soluble form. Surprisingly, chromatography on Sephadex G-10 showed it to have a molecular weight in the range of that of Ca2+. Analysis of gastric contents showed the stomach to be the initial site of release of Ca from the casein micelles. Although only 45% of the 45Ca was in a soluble form in stomach contents, 100% of this soluble 45Ca behaved as Ca2+. Comparison with the fate of 32P from milk confirmed the suggestion that most of the Ca is released as Ca2+. In vitro studies suggested that this release is the result of simple dilution or the combined action of intrinsic milk enzymes and dilution. Because milk Ca appears to enter the small intestine as Ca2+, we presume its mechanism of absorption in suckling animals is the same as that already established using simple salts of Ca.

These chemical modifications lead to the following results: (1) the inhibition of the enzyme by DFP is due to the phosphorylation of a single residue, probably a serine residue, which may represent the acylable group of the enzyme; (2) carbethoxylation of histidine residues leads to inhibition of the enzyme activity. Among the nine modified histidine residues, only one is essential for enzyme activity; (3) a free carboxyl group with a pKa of 5.4 is also involved in catalysis. These three essential residues are involved in the enzymatic hydrolysis of substrates whatever their physical state (soluble or emulsified). Upon treatment with DFP as well as with ethoxyformic anhydride, the enzyme remains able to bind to the model interface formed by siliconized glass-beads with almost the same efficiency (Kd between 4.1 and 7.4.10(-8) M) than the native bile-salt-stimulated lipase (Kd = 6.3.10(-8) M).

2469454,"A member of the high molecular weight glycoproteins of human milk and breast cancer was isolated from the sera, ascites and breast carcinoma tissue of patients with breast cancer using monoclonal antibody 3E1.2. The 3E1.2 defined antigen, termed mammary serum antigen (MSA) was obtained by immunoaffinity chromatography and a solid phase immuno-precipitation technique (SPIT) from serum of patients with metastatic breast cancer. MSA was found to be a high molecular weight glycoprotein with a Mr greater than 300,000 by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and a native Mr approximately 1 x 10(6) by gel filtration chromatography; in accord with the published Mr of other high molecular weight glycoproteins obtained from human milk and breast cancer. A high degree of glycosylation of MSA molecule was shown by its poor staining with Coomassie blue but good staining in a PAS-silver stain. In addition, MSA contained N-acetyl neuraminic acid and N-acetyl glucosamine as indicated by its binding to wheat-germ agglutinin. The epitope defined by antibody 3E1.2 is sensitive to treatment by sodium periodate and neuraminidase, implying that both carbohydrate and sialic acid are required for binding of antibody 3E1.2. Sandwich immunoassays demonstrated that MSA+ molecules are likely to express repeated 3E1.2 defined epitopes. Furthermore, MSA was susceptible to degradation by pronase, subtilisin and proteinase K and gave a different peptide profile from that of the PAS-O glycoprotein of human milk. MSA+ molecules were found to carry epitopes for a number of other monoclonal antibodies which were reactive with the PAS-O glycoprotein. It is suggested that MSA has the same core protein as is recognised by antibody DF3 which has been used to clone the same cDNA as was cloned with antibodies HMFG-1, HMFG-2 and SM-3. However, the epitope detected by the 3E1.2 antibody is either absent or weakly expressed on human milk, human milk-fat globule membrane (HMFGM) or deglycosylated HMFGM--all of which react strongly with various anti-HMFG antibodies.

Each variable was evaluated by gel filtration, anion-exchange chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis, and immunodiffusion. The optimum method for a discrete separation of whey and casein is the adjustment of whole milk to pH 4.3 with addition of 60 mmol calcium/L, followed by ultracentrifugation.

Resistance to proteolytic degradation in the stomach is necessary if ingested EGF is to function within the gastrointestinal tract. Although EGF stability to low pH and proteases predicts gastric survival, the extent of digestion in the stomach remains to be defined. Consequently, we measured gastric degradation of 125I-human recombinant EGF in preterm infants with an in vitro method in which EGF was incubated at 37 degrees C with stomach fluid at pH 1.8, 3.2, and 5.8 followed by analysis of degradation products. As maximal acid proteolytic activity is present one hour after feeding in preterm infants, fluid was obtained at that time from 18 infants with a mean gestational age at birth of 30.4 (3.0) (SD) weeks and a postnatal age of 26.3 (12.7) days at sampling. Incubations for up to 60 minutes revealed minimal loss of trichloroacetic acid precipitable radioactivity, in contrast to the substantial hydrolysis of iodinated casein which occurred under the same conditions. Chromatography of reaction mixtures on Sephadex G-25 showed a single major peak of radioactivity which coeluted with EGF.

2918047,"We measured plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-casomorphin-8, a product of beta-casein hydrolysis which has opioid activity, by RIA in women during late pregnancy and lactation and in nonpregnant nonpuerperal women. Before RIA, the samples were acidified and extracted by reverse phase silica gel chromatography, which removed most of the beta-casein. Lactating women had a significantly higher mean plasma beta-casomorphin-8 concentration (2.66 nmol/L; n = 8) than women in late pregnancy (0.82 nmol/L; n = 8) and nonpregnant women (0.32 nmol/L; n = 5). The CSF beta-casomorphin-8 concentration also was significantly higher in lactating women (mean, 0.35 nmol/L; n = 8) than during late pregnancy (0.22 nmol/L; n = 8) or in nonpregnant women (0.15 nmol/L; n = 5). A positive correlation was found between plasma and CSF beta-casomorphin-8 levels in the entire study group. The milk beta-casomorphin-8 concentration, measured in five puerperal women, averaged 19.8 nmol/L. Thus, there is a decreasing concentration gradient between milk and plasma and between plasma and CSF. Chromatographic analysis revealed mol wt heterogeneity of the RIA-active material. In CSF at least three different components were detected, two of mol wt around 900-2,000 and one of approximately 12,000. One of the low mol wt components coeluted in several chromatographic systems with synthetic beta-casomorphin-8 (mol wt, 900). Such a component was not found in milk or plasma, in which the major activity was due to larger sized peptides. The major peaks in milk were around 1,500-2,000 and 12,000 mol wt, corresponding to the larger peaks in CSF. The results suggest that fragments of the milk protein beta-casein may cross the breast parenchyma-blood barrier into plasma and subsequently penetrate the blood-brain barrier to reach the central nervous system.

The women consumed either a low fat (LF) (5% fat, 80% CHO) diet or a high fat (HF) (40% fat, 45% CHO) diet. Fat synthesis was determined after an oral dose of 500 mg/kg D2O by measuring the incorporation of deuterium into C10:0 to C18:0 saturated fatty acids of milk fat and plasma triglycerides by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Synthesis of plasma C16:0 and C18:0 triglycerides was barely detectable while women consumed the HF diet, but was increased 6-fold during the LF diet. Medium chain fatty acids secreted by the mammary gland increased from 12.8% (HF diet) to 16.3% (LF diet) in milk fat from four of five subjects (p = 0.027). Medium chain fatty acid secretion, however, increased from 13.9% (HF diet) to 29.9% (LF diet) in one subject. The primary fatty acids synthesized during lactation were C10:0, C12:0, and C14:0 in the majority of women studied.

The breast-fed babies had a median cotinine to creatinine ratio of 433 ng/mg, whereas the bottle-fed babies' median was 200 ng/mg (P less than 10(-4)). Similar differences were observed after adjustment for the number of cigarettes smoked by the mother and by other smokers in the home in the previous 24 hours. The correlation coefficient between the number of cigarettes smoked by the mother and the breast milk cotinine concentration was significant (r = .69, P = 2 X 10(-4)). Moreover, urine cotinine values from the breast-fed babies increased with higher concentrations of cotinine in the mother's milk (r = .56, P = .02).

Sixteen blood samples were obtained from cord, and 19 at 6-8 h after birth, 14 at 1 week and 9 at 4 weeks from HM-fed infants and 18 at 1 week and 14 at 4 weeks from MF-fed ones. Groups had similar mean birth weight, gestational age and sex ratio. The MF provided 69 kcal/dl and contained 16% of linoleic acid and 1.3% of alpha-linolenic acid on the total fat. Plasma lipid fractions were extracted and separated by thin-layer chromatography and fatty acid methyl esters were quantitated by gas liquid chromatography. In plasma phospholipids, linoleic acid (18:2 omega 6) continuously increased from birth to 1 month of age, but no changes were seen as related to type of diet; polyunsaturated fatty acids greater than 18 carbon atoms of both the omega 6 and omega 3 series (PUFA omega 6 greater than 18 C and omega 3 greater than 18 C) dropped from birth to 1 week and continued to decrease in MF-fed infants until 1 month; eicosatrienoic (20:3 omega 6), arachidonic (20:4 omega 6) and docosahexaenoic (22:6 omega 3) were the fatty acids implicated. In cholesteryl esters palmitoleic (16:1 omega 7) and oleic (18:1 omega 9) acids decreased from birth to 1 month and linoleic acid increased and arachidonic acid dropped, especially in MF fed infants. In triglycerides, palmitic, palmitoleic and stearic acid (18:0) decreased during the first month of life; oleic acid remained constant and linoleic acid increased in all infants, but arachidonic acid decreased only in those fed formula.

After limited proteolysis, a large proportion of trace minerals in human milk was found in the low molecular weight fraction, whereas in cow's milk a large proportion was bound to incompletely digested casein.

As the examinations promised, the content of phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and sphingomyelin (SP) was not changed by homogenization and pasteurization of cow's milk. Levels of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) were below the detection limit. Furthermore it has been proved that human milk and cow's milk are more or less identical in PL content. Some of the PL in human milk varies during the course of pregnancy and postpartum. PI, PC, and SP content in the prepartum mammarial secretion lies above the average content of mature human milk after delivery. Before the contractions start, all the PL examined show a more or less considerable decrease. PC drops to 30% of the value at the beginning of the examination six weeks before delivery. PG contents are very low throughout the whole period. Contrary to the others, PC content recovers three weeks after delivery, which may be the result of the endogenous surfactant replacement system. To compare PL content with human milk and cow's milk, 13 different infant formulas have been examined. There are considerable differences to be found in and among adapted milk, partially adapted milk, and special formulas. None of the PL examined could be found in all the infant formulas, where PG content was usually low, except in some Milupa formulas. PE and PI were not to be found in some special formulas. Most of the formulas contain high amounts of SP, in some cases higher than the amount of PC. To a certain extent infant formulas contain a considerably greater amount of other PL concentrations than human milk and cow's milk. In most of the formulas examined the PL content is generally so high, that it can be used as a source of PL for the newborn.",Zeitschrift fur Ernahrungswissenschaft,"['D000818', 'D002417', 'D002851', 'D005260', 'D005511', 'D006801', 'D007225', 'D008892', 'D008895', 'D010743']","['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Food Handling', 'Humans', 'Infant Food', 'Milk', 'Milk, Human', 'Phospholipids']","Determination of the phospholipid content of human milk, cow's milk and various infant formulas.","[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3239113,1989,0

Since human intake of zearalenone and its metabolites via milk is an unknown factor in risk assessment of zearalenone and because appropriate methodology for their determination in milk is not available, a rapid and sensitive analytical method has been developed. Essentially, the method includes extraction with basic acetonitrile, acidification, partition into methylene chloride on a hydrophilic matrix, cleanup on an aminopropyl solid phase extraction column, and reverse-phase liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Recoveries from milk averaged 84% for zearalenone, 93% for alpha-zearalenol, and 90% for beta-zearalenol at spiking levels of 0.5 to 20 ng/mL. As little as 0.2 ng/mL of zearalenone and alpha-zearalenol and 2 ng/mL of beta-zearalenol can be detected in milk.

3401012,"Since caseins were originally defined as phosphoproteins, nonphosphorylated beta-casein, comprising nearly 5% of the total beta-casein in the isoelectric precipitate from human milk, appears to be unique. Despite the relatively small amount present, its properties suggest that it may play an important role in micelle formation and structure. It has a partial specific volume, v, of 0.749 +/- 0.008 and an absorbance, E1% 1 cm,280 nm of 6.2 +/- 0.2. Sedimentation and viscosity data yield a solvation of 3 g H2O/g protein and an axial ratio of about 5 for the monomer. This would be consistent with a prolate ellipsoid of 10 nm length and 2 nm width. Equilibrium in the system is attained quite slowly and the temperature-dependent polymerization was found to be reversible. With calcium, the solubility behavior reflects an increased hydrophobicity and lower electrostatic repulsion in the molecule. There is essentially no strong calcium binding to this protein but there is evidence which strongly suggests that calcium binds to nonphosphate groups at higher concentrations. Increasing the temperature from 4 to 37 degrees C causes an apparent conformational change and an increase in protein aggregation which is further increased by addition of NaCl at 37 degrees C until a limiting size is reached at about 0.1 M NaCl. This limiting size polymer contains about 75 monomers and is nearly spherical with a radius of about 12 nm and a solvation of 1.5 g H2O/g protein.

Thin-layer chromatography immunostaining of neutral glycolipids extracted from SLC cells reveals a 43-9F-reactive glycolipid whose carbohydrate structure, as determined by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, is identical with that of an Lea-active pentaglycosylceramide described previously: Gal beta 1-3[Fuc alpha 1-4]-GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc-Cer. However, the Lea-active oligosaccharide hapten, lacto-N-fucopentaose II, with the same carbohydrate structure, fails to inhibit binding of 43-9F, and a well-characterized anti-Lea monoclonal antibody blocks only 40% of 43-9F binding sites on SLC cells, suggesting that the major epitope recognized by 43-9F is more complex than the Lea epitope. To search for a higher affinity 43-9F epitope among more complex oligosaccharides, a mixture of tritiated neutral oligosaccharide alditols from pooled human milk was passed through a 43-9F affinity column. A major retarded oligosaccharide was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and shown by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry to have the following structure: Gal beta 1-3[Fuc alpha 1-4]GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4[Fuc alpha 1-3] GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc.

The purified binding protein was homogeneous by the criteria of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high speed sedimentation equilibrium. 2. The isolated vitamin B12-binding protein was a glycoprotein with 24% carbohydrates (fucose, galactose, mannose, galactosamine, glucosamine and sialic acid) and high levels of aspartic and glutamic acids. The protein which has a molecular weight of 61,800 determined by ultracentrifugation, consisted of a single polypeptide chain, bound vitamin B12 on an equimolar basis and had a partial specific volume of 0.697 ml/g (mechanical oscillator technique). 3. Its dissociation constant, Kd, for cyanocobalamin was 8.8 x 10(-10)M. The binding protein showed similar affinities for hydroxo-, methyl-, and adenosylcobalamin when compared to cyanocobalamin relative affinity ratios, but lower affinities (31-49%) for cobinamide, Co-alpha-[adenyl] cobamide and Co-alpha-[2-methyl-adenyl] cobamide. Therefore, the substitution of the axial ligand to the cobalt atom in the corrin ring of vitamin B12 had no effect on affinity, whereas the differences in the nucleotide part of the molecule caused a small decrease in energy of the interaction. 4.

Biol. Chem. 256, 9684-9692 and (1985) 260, 14911-14917]. Iodination of a highly purified preparation of placental folate receptor (PFR) by various techniques resulted in significant denaturation of the PFR as evidenced by additional peaks of radioactivity on Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration in 1% Triton X-100. These denatured species had similar molecular weights on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as radioiodinated and native PFR, and were also recognized, albeit with less efficiency, by specific rabbit antiserum raised against purified PFR. Since these denatured species failed to bind folate, they were specifically excluded from 125I-PFR by their inability to bind pteroylglutamate-Sepharose. This ws accomplished in a single step by iodination of PFR bound to the affinity column and elution of 125I-PFR under identical conditions that the native PFR was purified. The purified 125I-PFR comigrated with unlabeled PFR on SDS-PAGE and its elution profile on Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration was identical to radioligand bound PFR. The resulting radioimmunoassay standard curve using this affinity chromatography purified 125I-PFR, unlabeled PFR, and anti-human PFR serum had a range for measurement between 5 and 500 ng of PFR and was not affected by the concentration of folate in the sample.

The major peak of LPL activity after gel filtration of PHP eluted after the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and just before the peak of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. When PHP contained chylomicrons, an additional peak of LPL activity eluted in the void volume of the column. Most HTGL activity eluted after the LDL and preceded the elution of high density lipoprotein cholesterol. LPL activity in preheparin plasma eluted in the same position, relative to lipoproteins, as did LPL in PHP. Gel filtration of purified human milk LPL mixed with plasma or isolated LDL produced a peak of activity eluting before LDL. During gel filtration of PHP in high salt buffer (1 M NaCl) or after isolation of lipoproteins by ultracentrifugation in high salt density solutions, most of the lipase activity was not associated with lipoproteins. LPL activity was removed from PHP by elution through immunoaffinity columns containing antibodies to apolipoprotein (apo) B and apo E.

We first confirmed that synthetic vitamin D2 and D3 sulfates could not be hydrolyzed by alkali but by acid. Breast or cow's milk was separated into milk whey containing water-soluble components and milk curd containing crude proteins and lipophilic components. The separated milk whey and curd were hydrolyzed by acid or alkali and each lipid extract was subjected to HPLC analysis. Neither peak due to vitamin D and 25-OH-D was observed in the chromatograms of acid- and alkali-hydrolyzed milk whey, whereas the peaks due to vitamin D3 and 25-OH-D3 were found in the chromatograms of both acid- and alkali-hydrolyzed milk curd and there was no significant difference between the respective peak heights. The eluates corresponding to the respective peaks observed on the latter's chromatograms were collected and subjected to UV, HPLC, GC-MS and GLC to identify the existence of vitamin D3 and 25-OH-D3, respectively. We concluded from these results that neither breast nor cow's milk contained water-soluble vitamin D and 25-OH-D sulfates, whereas they contained fat-soluble vitamin D3 and 25-OH-D3. The concentrations of vitamin D3 and 25-OH-D3 in breast milk were about 125 and 350 ng/liter, while those in cow's milk were about 420 and 270 ng/liter, respectively.

They were high at the peri-parturient period and then fell rapidly in the pig and more gradually in the women, to a relatively low and constant levels.

Cation-exchange chromatography on carboxymethyl-cellulose previously has been used to demonstrate the heterogeneity of the peroxidase enzymes isolated from human neutrophils. In this study, fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) was used to separate and purify three major (I, II, and III) and three minor (IIa, IIIa, IIIb) forms of MPO from isolated neutrophil granules. Purity was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CETAB-PAGE), by crossed immunoelectrophoresis, and by spectral characteristics. All three major forms were indistinguishable by immunodiffusion against rabbit antiserum, scanning spectrophotometry, and amino acid composition. They differed in their elution from a cation-exchange resin, inhibition by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, migration rate in CETAB-PAGE, and subunit molecular weight. Subunit molecular weight was examined using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). All three major forms appeared to consist of heavy (H), intermediate (M), and light (L) peptides. The M peptide appeared to be derived from the H subunit. All L subunits exhibited a molecular weight of 14,500. The molecular weights for the H subunits varied, and were 60,000, 59,000, and 57,000 for MPO I, II, and III, respectively. The molecular weights for the M peptides were 44,100, 43,000, and 42,000 for MPO I, II, and III, respectively.

Unesterified cholesterol levels in both groups were similar at all intervals, the cholesterol esters were higher at 14 and 28 days in BF infants. ApoA-I and ApoB levels were higher at 3 days in FF, but ApoC-III levels were the same. At all other sampling times, no discernible differences in these parameters were found between BF and FF. For the infants as a group, changes in levels with increasing age were similar for both ApoA-I and cholesterol esters, as was the case for ApoB and triacylglycerols. However, numerous differences between BF and FF were seen in molecular forms of triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters, reflecting the dietary fatty acid differences between breast milk and formula.

Five expired H2 during the first 2 weeks, and two continued to do so in the 3rd to 4th weeks. Breath H2 excretion fell below 10 ppm by 8 weeks and was not related to feeding or sleep. In term neonates, the frequency of incomplete carbohydrate absorption (4-h test) at the end of the first week was 36% for 14 breast-fed, 42% for 12 formula-fed, and 64% for 14 mixed-fed neonates (not significant differences).

In summary, incomplete carbohydrate absorption occurred in a high percentage of the newborns studied; the 24-h test evaluated better than the 4-h test; and negative breath H2 excretion indicated development of the capacity of the small intestine to hydrolyze carbohydrates.

Components B and C were stained with peanut (Arachis hypogaea) agglutinin (PNA) and wheat (Triticum)-germ agglutinin (WGA), Component A being stained with soya-bean (Glycine max) agglutinin as well as PNA and WGA. These results suggest that Components B and C were related molecules, whereas Component A was markedly different from them. The reactivities of Components B and C were the same as those of PAS-0, a high-Mr periodate/Schiff (PAS)-positive glycoprotein previously isolated from human milk fat-globule membrane (MFGM). Component C, whose electrophoretic mobility was the same as PAS-0, could have been a soluble form of PAS-0. A high-Mr glycoprotein having the same properties as Component A was also observed in MFGM. The amino acid composition of the isolated Component A was significantly different from that of Component C and PAS-0, high threonine and serine contents being characteristic of Component A. The carbohydrate content of Component A was 65-80%, and was much higher than that of Component C and PAS-0. Fucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine and sialic acid were each detected as constituent sugars of Component A. Component A represents, therefore, a new high-Mr glycoprotein species in human milk serum and MFGM. Since these glycoproteins were high-Mr mucin-like glycoproteins, the names 'HM glycoprotein-A' and 'HM glycoprotein-C' were proposed for Component A and Component C (PAS-O) respectively.",The Biochemical journal,"['D000596', 'D002241', 'D002850', 'D004591', 'D006023', 'D006801', 'D008565', 'D008894', 'D008895', 'D008970']","['Amino Acids', 'Carbohydrates', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Glycoproteins', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Milk Proteins', 'Milk, Human', 'Molecular Weight']",High-Mr glycoprotein profiles in human milk serum and fat-globule membrane.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', None, None, 'Q000302', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000302', 'Q000378', None]","['analysis', 'analysis', None, None, 'isolation & purification', None, 'metabolism', 'isolation & purification', 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3707520,1986,0
3000589,"Crude, delipidated milk and the acid:ethanol extracts of primary human breast tumors contain several activities that biologically resemble transforming growth factors (TGFs) in that they promote the anchorage-independent growth of normal rat kidney and Mm5mt/c1 mouse mammary tumor cells in soft agar. Three major TGF species with isoelectric points (pl) of about 4.0, 6.0-6.5, and 7.0 have been detected in both tumors and milk. The pl 4.0 species from milk has been purified about 10,000-fold by isoelectric focusing and high-performance liquid chromatography. This species, designated milk-derived growth factor II (MDGFII), coelutes from gel filtration columns with an authentic human epidermal growth factor standard when using a low ionic strength eluting buffer. However, on the same column, MDGFII is completely resolved from human epidermal growth factor with high ionic strength eluting buffers. Nevertheless, MDGFII purified by the latter technique still competes with 125I-epidermal growth factor for receptor binding to A431 cell membranes. Additionally the TGF activity of MDGFII present in the pl 4.0 fraction of milk is markedly inhibited by anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody preparations. Consequently MDGFII appears to be an alpha-TGF.

3514589,"In order to determine the distribution of two human urinary RNase (RNase Us and RNase UL)-like enzymes in human tissues and body fluids, enzyme immunoassay systems were established using rabbit anti-RNase sera. The sensitivity of the assay systems was of similar order to that of radioimmunoassay systems previously reported. In the enzyme immunoassay, the cross reactivities of anti-RNase UL serum towards RNase Us, bovine kidney RNase K2, bovine RNase A, and bovine seminal RNase Vs were less than 1%. The cross reactivity of anti-RNase Us-serum towards RNase UL was less than 0.5% and cross reactivities were minimal for RNase A, RNase K2, and RNase Vs. The RNase levels in human organs and body fluids were measured by enzyme immunoassay. In milk, semen and saliva, only RNase UL-like enzyme was found. Both RNase Us- and RNase UL-like enzymes were found in kidney, stomach, and pancreas and the RNase Us/RNase UL ratios were 0.49, 1.35, and 0.34, respectively. In lung, liver, spleen, and leukocytes, most of the RNase activity was accounted for by RNase Us-like enzyme. The activity of RNase Us-like enzyme was especially high in lung, spleen, and leukocytes. The crude extracts of several tissues and body fluids were separated by phosphocellulose column chromatography and the contents of the two urinary RNase-like enzymes were determined by enzyme immunoassay.

2414233,"The monoclonal antibody (MAb) NCRC-11 identifies an epitope expressed variably in human breast cancer. The degree of expression of this epitope in primary operable tumours is closely related to the subsequent clinical course of the disease (Ellis et al., 1985). The target antigen for NCRC-11 was isolated from subcellular membranes of breast carcinomas and purified by immunoadsorbent chromatography. NCRC-11 epitopes were expressed upon a large glycoprotein of more than 400 kd. This material was susceptible to degradation by pronase and papain and contained N-acetylglucosamine, as indicated by its binding to wheat-germ agglutinin. The NCRC-11-defined antigen expressed epitopes for the anti-human milk-fat globule membrane antibodies HMFG-1 and HMFG-2, and other antibodies against epithelial membrane antigens (EMA, LICR-LON-M8). The reactivity of these antibodies with tumour membranes was also similar, but not identical, to that of the NCRC-11 antibody. In competitive binding-inhibition assays, these antibodies partially inhibited the binding of 125I-NCRC-11 antibody to antigen, suggesting that the epitopes involved are topographically closely associated. Sandwich immunoassays demonstrated that NCRC-11 epitopes are likely to represent repeated structures of the NCRC-11 antigen.

4062286,"Human beta-casein was separated according to the extent of phosphorylation and the fully phosphorylated moiety was characterized. Fully phosphorylated human beta-casein makes up to 13-15% of the beta-casein fraction. It has a partial specific volume, v, of 0.754 +/- 0.008 and an absorbancy, E1(1%)cm,280 nm of 6.4 +/- 0.2. Sedimentation and viscosity data yield a solvation of 2.9 g H2O/g protein and an axial ratio of about 5 for the monomer. This would be consistent with a prolate ellipsoid of 10 nm length and 2 nm width. There is one strong binding site for Ca2+ for each organic phosphate ester in the molecule. The protein will precipitate at room temperature upon the addition of either 10 mM Ca2+ or greater than 1 M NaCl. Increasing the temperature from 4 to 37 degrees C causes an apparent conformational change and an increase in protein aggregation which is further increased by the addition of NaCl at this temperature until a limiting size is reached at about 0.25 M NaCl. This limiting size polymer contains 95-105 monomers and is nearly spherical with a radius of about 15 nm and a solvation of 3 g H2O/g protein. If this polymer were the submicelle of human casein, it could account for the abnormally high solvation of human casein micelles but their small average size would be more difficult to reconcile without additional information concerning K-casein association.

Radiocopper was added to the diet in trace amounts. Ultracentrifugation, ultrafiltration, and gel filtration were used to show that the added 64Cu bound to milk fractions and individual binding compounds in a manner analogous to the distribution of native copper, thus validating the use of extrinsically labeled diets. Labeled diets were intubated into 14-day-old suckling rats. Animals were killed after 6 h and tissues removed and counted.

6587347,"Acyclovir [9-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]guanine] is an acyclic guanine nucleoside analogue that is widely used clinically as an antiherpetic agent. Its limited absorption in humans after oral administration prompted the search for prodrugs. A congener, referred to as 6- deoxyacyclovir [2-amino-9-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]-9H-purine], was synthesized and found to be 18 times more water soluble than was acyclovir. Surprisingly, this congener was readily oxidized to acyclovir by xanthine oxidase (EC 1.2.3.2). It was also oxidized by aldehyde oxidase (EC 1.2.3.1) largely to 8-hydroxy-6- deoxyacyclovir [2-amino-8-hydroxy-9-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]-9H-purine] and then to 8- hydroxyacyclovir [2-amino-6,8-dihydroxy-9[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]-9H-purine]. 6- Deoxyacyclovir and the major products of its oxidation by aldehyde oxidase lacked appreciable activity against herpes simplex type I in vitro. On the basis of these results, it was apparent that the success of 6- deoxyacyclovir as a prodrug in vivo would depend upon how well its desired activation by xanthine oxidase competed with the nonactivating oxidations by aldehyde oxidase. In rats dosed orally with 6- deoxyacyclovir , absorption was extensive and the major urinary metabolite was acyclovir. In two human volunteers, urinary excretions of acyclovir were 5-6 times greater than those typically observed after administration of equivalent doses of acyclovir itself. The areas under the plasma concentration-time curves for acyclovir were also 5-6 times greater. Plasma levels of acyclovir peaked soon after ingestion of the prodrug, indicating rapid absorption and metabolic conversion. These results suggested that 6- deoxyacyclovir might have clinical usefulness as a prodrug of acyclovir suitable for oral administration.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"['D000212', 'D042931', 'D000445', 'D000493', 'D000818', 'D000998', 'D001711', 'D002417', 'D002851', 'D005260', 'D007700', 'D008099', 'D009682', 'D008892', 'D010084', 'D011817', 'D013056', 'D014969']","['Acyclovir', 'Aldehyde Oxidase', 'Aldehyde Oxidoreductases', 'Allopurinol', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Biotransformation', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Kinetics', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Milk', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Rabbits', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Xanthine Oxidase']",6-Deoxyacyclovir: a xanthine oxidase-activated prodrug of acyclovir.,"['Q000031', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000494', None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000201', None, 'Q000201', None, None, None, 'Q000378']","['analogs & derivatives', None, 'metabolism', 'pharmacology', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, 'enzymology', None, 'enzymology', None, None, None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6587347,1984,0

6378814,"One of the most dangerous and pernicious forms of pollution arises from the potential mobilization of a spectrum of toxic trace metals and metalloids in our environment. Among the most important elements in this regard are arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium and selenium whose adverse toxic effects are now well recognized including their carcinogenicity and/or mutagenicity. These agents (and their derivatives) can be widely dispersed throughout the environment as a result of fossil fuel combustion, industrial and agricultural processes and natural processes. The trend for the immediate future appears to be of greater exposure to these metals not only as a result of generally increased usage patterns but also because of prospective enhanced use of fossil fuels for space heating and electricity generation. In order to more readily evaluate trends of human exposure as well as the toxicity, bioavailability, bioaccumulation and transport of these elements, sensitive analytical procedures are required for the determination of their various oxidation states (as well as their organic derivatives) in complex matrices such as those found in both environmental and biological samples. Hence, the principal objective of this overview is to highlight the more recent trends and state-of-the-art methodologies for the determination of arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium and selenium (in their various forms) in environmental compartments such as air, water, soil and in human tissues (primarily blood, urine, and milk).

6689130,"Fractionation of pancreatic juice by heparin-Sepharose and cholate-Sepharose affinity chromatography indicated that pancreatic carboxylesterase can be separated from pancreatic lipase with the former retained and the latter unretained by both columns. The chromatographic behavior of pancreatic carboxylesterase was found to be similar to that of human milk bile salt-activated lipase. The partially purified pancreatic carboxylesterase had a specific activity of 30 mumol/min per mg protein when assayed with p-nitrophenyl acetate. The reaction mechanism of human pancreatic carboxylesterase was studied using p-nitrophenyl acetate as substrate and taurocholate as activator. The reaction of the enzyme was found to follow a rapid-equilibrium random mechanism. Because of the presence of basal activity, the role of taurocholate can be considered as a non-essential activator and the dissociation constant for the enzyme-taurocholate binary complex was determined to be 0.20 mM. The activation effect of taurocholate consists in increasing the affinity of the enzyme to the substrate (5.6-fold) and in increasing the Vmax (2.3-fold). Based on the kinetic property of human pancreatic carboxylesterase and human milk bile salt-activated lipase with p-nitrophenyl acetate, cholesterol oleate and triolein as substrate, we conclude that they share common substrate specificity but show minor differences in kinetic parameters. Fluorescence studies indicated that both enzymes showed a decreased intrinsic tryptophanyl fluorescence upon incubation with taurocholate.

By using 0.5% Ni(II) as a matrix modifier to prevent selenium losses during the ashing step, it was shown that selenium can be determined in samples containing greater than or equal to 1 microgram Se/g dry wt without organic extraction. The mean recovery tested, using NBS Bovine Liver, was 98%; recovery of added inorganic selenium in Bovine Liver matrix was 100%. In addition, this method gave values closest to the median value of all participating laboratories using hydride generation AAS or the spectrofluorometric method in a collaborative study on high selenium wheat, flour, and toast samples. For samples with concentrations less than 1 microgram Se/g dry wt, separation of selenium from interfering Fe and P ions by organic extraction was necessary.

These immuno- and lectin-histochemical investigations revealed that tumors with a high secretory activity responded in about 80% to endocrine treatment, whereas breast carcinomas that exhibited no secretory function failed to respond to endocrine therapy.

To determine whether similar peptides or alkaloids occur in other foodstuffs, we have screened potential sources using a rat brain homogenate assay to detect opiate receptor activity. We report here that instant coffee powders from a variety of manufacturers compete with tritiated naloxone for binding to opiate receptors in the rat brain membrane preparations, with no significant difference between normal and decaffeinated coffee. The receptor binding activity resembles that seen with opiate antagonists, in that there was no change in the half-maximal effective dose (ED50) in the presence of 100 mM Na+; on bioassay, the activity was similarly shown to be antagonistic and specific for opiate-induced inhibition of twitch. Preliminary characterization of the activity reveals that it has a molecular weight (MW) in the range 1,000-3,500, is heat-stable, ether-extractable, not modified by enzymatic digestion with papain, and clearly separable from caffeine and morphine on TLC.

6398618,"This volume covers the history of thiamin, its chemistry and biochemistry, methods for the assessment of thiamin status, and the clinical chemistry of thiamin.  Thiamin plays an essential role in carbohydrate metabolism, and there is some evidence it may also affect protein and lipid biosynthesis.  Thiamin is composed of pyrimidine and thiazole moieties that are joined by a methylene bridge.  The daily requirement of thiamin is related to energy need, especially that which is derived from carbohydrate.  0.33 mg of thiamin is required for each 4400 kJ of energy requirement; thus, a thiamin intake of 0.5 mg/4400 kJ has been recommended for adults and children of all ages.  Measurement of blood levels, the excretion rate of the vitamin, the abnormal metabolic products resulting from a deficient state, or some other product dependent on the concentration of the vitamin in the body have been used to assess thiamin status.  Clinical states that may be associated with a change in thiamin status include Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy, megablastic anemia, maple syrup urine disease, and beriberi.  There is no evidence that oral contraceptives have an adverse effect on thiamin metabolism.  There is an increased requirement for thiamin during pregnancy, which may result in a deficiency in the mother.  Moreover, thiamin deficiency has been implicated as a factor in toxemia of pregnancy. The concentration of thiamin in human breast milk is related to maternal intake of the vitamin, and cow's milk contains considerably more thiamin than human milk.",Advances in clinical chemistry,"['D000328', 'D000368', 'D000375', 'D000437', 'D000749', 'D000818', 'D001602', 'D001681', 'D001692', 'D001933', 'D002540', 'D055598', 'D002621', 'D002851', 'D003276', 'D004590', 'D005260', 'D006358', 'D006801', 'D007408', 'D007774', 'D007888', 'D008027', 'D008722', 'D009336', 'D009751', 'D011247', 'D013398', 'D013831', 'D013832', 'D014899']","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aging', 'Alcoholism', 'Anemia, Megaloblastic', 'Animals', 'Beriberi', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Transport', 'Brain Stem', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Contraceptives, Oral', 'Electrophoresis, Paper', 'Female', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Lactation', 'Leigh Disease', 'Light', 'Methods', 'Necrosis', 'Nutritional Requirements', 'Pregnancy', 'Sudden Infant Death', 'Thiamine', 'Thiamine Deficiency', 'Wernicke Encephalopathy']",Clinical chemistry of thiamin.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000150', 'Q000209', None, 'Q000503', None, None, 'Q000648', 'Q000473', None, None, None, 'Q000009', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000209', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000209', 'Q000502', 'Q000150', 'Q000209']","[None, None, None, 'complications', 'etiology', None, 'physiopathology', None, None, 'ultrastructure', 'pathology', None, None, None, 'adverse effects', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'etiology', None, None, None, None, None, 'etiology', 'physiology', 'complications', 'etiology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6398618,1985,0

A new method was devised, based on complete precipitation of milk proteins with saturated ammonium sulphate and progressive solubilization of the precipitate on a column of Sephadex G10 with a linear gradient of ammonium sulphate (from saturation to water). Three fractions were obtained. The first contained lactoferrin, serum albumin, lysozyme and traces of alpha-lactalbumin. Lysozyme could be obtained free from contaminants by chromatography on Ultrogel AcA 54. Lactoferrin and serum albumin coeluting as a single peak, were separated by a further chromatography on DEAE-cellulose.

7068573,"Milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) enclosing fat droplets in human milk was found to contain a high molecular weight glycoprotein which did not migrate in 10% acrylamide gel on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). This glycoprotein (termed PAS-0) was isolated by Sepharose CL-4B chromatography. Isolated PAS-0 gave one band on SDS-PAGE using 5% acrylamide gel (acrylamide : bisacrylamide = 4 : 1, w/w) and gave one peak on analytical ultracentrifugation, indicating its homogeneity. PAS-0 was rich in serine, threonine, proline, glycine, and alanine. In contrast, contents of sulfur-containing amino acids were very low. Fucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, and sialic acid were detected as constituent sugars of PAS-0 and the total carbohydrate content was about 50%. Alkali-borohydride treatment suggested that the carbohydrate moiety was linked to the polypeptide core with O-glycosidic bond(s). There results suggested that PAS-0 was a mucin-like glycoprotein. PAS-0 was shown to be resistant to pepsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin digestion, but susceptible to Pronase and Subtilisin BPN'. Extraction of intact milk fat globules (cream) with MgCl2 and guanidine hydrochloride solutions suggested that PAS-0 was an intrinsic component of MFGM. Digestion of cream with Subtilisin BPN' demonstrated that PAS-0 was located on the external surface of fat globules and was accessible to molecules outside the globules.

The enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain with tryptophan at the N- and leucine at the C-terminus. Its molecular weight is approx. 45,000 and the isoelectric point is at pH 4.4. With albumin as a substrate an apparent Km was determined to be 7 . 10(-5) M. The enzyme is inhibited by pepstatin at equimolar ratio and thus is a carboxyl proteinase (EC 3.4.23.6). Other group-specific inhibitors, though, did not efficiently block the enzyme. Above pH 8.4 the enzyme undergoes alkaline denaturation which is accompanied by dimerization.

7216169,"Bifidobacterium lactentis 659 a gram-positive, nonsporeforming anaerobic bacterium originally isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants produces neuraminidase after enzyme induction with 2mM N-acetylmannosamine added to the culture medium. Bacteria were transferred and grown in a medium containing casein hydrolysate, lactose, sodium acetate, amino acids, vitamins, salts and 2% human milk for 48 h at 37 degrees C under N2/CO2 atmosphere. Two subcultures derived from the original strain B. lactentis 659 were investigated separately because of different growth characteristics. However, their taxonomic identity was not doubtful. Neuraminidase was liberated from the bacterial sediments by ultrasonic treatment in 0.15M NaCl and was isolated by 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialysis, concentration, and column chromatography on Sepharose CL-6B and Sephadex G-100. The enzyme exhibits a molecular weight of 38000 and a pH optimum in the range of pH 5--6 in barbital/acetate buffers. Starch gel electrophoresis and neuraminidase-specific staining with NeuAc alpha 2 leads to (3-methoxyphenyl) glycoside revealed two major and three minor enzyme bands. Michaelis constants (Km) were determined to be 7.1 mM for the (alpha 2 leads to 3) linkage of II3NeuAc-Lac, 7.5mM for the (alpha 2 leads to 6) linkage of II6Neu-Ac-Lac and 15mM for the (alpha 2 leads to 8) linkage in II3(leads from 2NeuAc8)2-Lac. Among the different groups of naturally occurring NeuAc-containing substrates, i.e. glycoproteins, gangliosides and oligosaccharides, B. lactentis neuraminidase cleaves oligosaccharides preferentially without remarkable differences between (alpha 2 leads to 3) and (alpha 2 leads to 6) linkages. Globular glycoproteins and mucins are poor substrates and gangliosides are practically not affected. In contrast, enzyme activity towards synthetic NeuAc glycosides is very high. The enzyme is activated by 50% with 50mM Ca2 and inhibited by 20mM EDTA accordingly.

Human exposure resulted principally from ingestion of contaminated dairy food products. To determine whether PBB exposure has or will cause acute or chronic illness, a prospective cohort study of 4545 persons has been undertaken. Three exposure groups were sought; all persons living on PBB-quarantined farms; persons who had received food directly from such farms; workers (and their families) engaged in PBB manufacture. Enrollment rates were 95.6, 95.1 and 78.0%. Also enrolled were 725 persons with low-level PBB exposure. All were queried concerning 17 symptoms and conditions related possibly to PBB. Venous blood was drawn on 3639 and analyzed for PBB by gas chromatography. Mean serum PBB levels were 26.9 ppb in quarantined farm families, 17.1 in recipients, 43.0 ppb in workers, and 3.4 ppb in the low exposure groups. No associations were found between serum PBB levels and symptom prevalence rates. To evaluate peripheral lymphocyte function, T and B cell quantitation and in vitro responses to 3 nonspecific mitogens were studied in 34 persons with highest PBB levels (mean, 787 ppb), and in 56 with low values (mean, 2.8 ppb).

The former folate binding fraction (FB) could be isolated from whey by means of ion exchange chromatography. Equilibrium dialysis experiments with whey and isolated FB indicated the existence of cooperatively interacting sites in folate binding. The folate analogue methotrexate inhibited folate binding. Inhibition was apparently of a competitive type since methotrexate did not reduce maximum binding capacity. Cooperativity was lost in the presence of methotrexate.

Dexamethasone-binding activity could not be detected. The concentration of corticosteroid-binding protein in the colostrum obtained before parturition is about 0.1 muM; the concentration declines rapidly after parturition to about 0.01 muM.

Cow and pig erythrocyte membrane glycoproteins were found however to contain much lower amounts than the erythrocyte membrane glycoproteins of the other species tested. After gel filtration, a tetrasaccharide was isolated from horse and sheep glycoproteins containing the disaccharide plus two molecules of sialic acid. Periodate oxidation together with paper chromatography of alkaline degraded fragments showed these two molecules of sialic acid to be linked to positions C3 and C6 of the galactosyl and N-acetylgalactosamine residues respectively. Evidence was obtained for a similar structure from pig and cow erythrocyte glycoproteins and human milk fat globule membrane glycoproteins although the complete structure was not elucidated. In all native glycoprotein fractions, the unsubstituted disaccharide beta-D-galactosyl (1-3)-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine was found to be present to different extents.

The vitamin B12-binding protein present in granulocytes obtained from normal subjects has been purified approximately 5000-fold using affinity chromatography on vitamin B12-Sepharose as the sole purification technique. The final preparations of all three proteins were homogeneous based on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Transcobalamin I and transcobalamin III belong to the R-typed class of vitamin B12-binding proteins and are indistinguishable from each other, and from the human granulocyte, milk, and saliva R-type vitamin B12-binding proteins, when studied by immunodiffusion with rabbit anti-human milk vitamin B12-binding protein sera.

6436,"Using lysozyme-lysate of Micrococcus lysodeikticus cell wall coupled with Sepharose, several bacteriolytic enzymes were purified from crude preparations of animal and microbial origin. Quail egg-white, human milk and salivary lysozymes [EC 3.2.1.17] were adsorbed onto the adsorbent at pH 5-7 and eluted with 2M NaCl at pH 10. By means of these treatments, lysozymes were purified 20-250 fold with activity recoveries of 60-80%, and the quail lysozyme thus purified was shown to be discelectrophoretically homogeneous. Some bacteriolytic enzymes of microbial origin were also highly purified by using this affinity adsorbent. A bacterial lysozyme from Bacillus sp. ML-208 showed high affinity for the ligand and was not eluted under the conditions mentioned above, but was recovered by elution with 2M guanidine-HCl at pH 5.8, resulting in a 500-fold increase in the specific activity. A Pseudomonas-lytic enzyme from Streptomyces sp. P-51 was easily released from the adsorbent by elution with 0.5M NaCl at pH 5.0. A staphylolytic F2 enzyme from S. griseus S-35 and a chitinase [EC 3.2.1.14] from yam, both of which were completely inert toward M. lysodeikticus cell wall, passed through the adsorbent column. A modified ligand, in which muramic acid and glucosamine residues were N,O-acetylated, failed to adsorb any of these animal and bacterial lysozymes.

The anti-BGG antibodies were shown to give rise to falsely high IgE values in the radio-immunosorbent test for IgE determination (RIST) when a sheep anti-IgE antiserum was used.

When a rabbit anti-IgE antiserum was used instead of the sheep anti-IgE, normal IgE levels and negative RAST results were obtained.

The milk fats of man, dog, and guinea pig, which were largely made up of long-chain fatty acids, showed a common pattern with major contributions made by the glycerides with 48-54 acyl carbon atoms. The milk fats of cow, sheep, and goat, which were rich in short-chain acids, showed significant proportions of triglycerides with 28-54 acyl carbon atoms. Horse milk, which contains large amounts of medium-chain fatty acids, gave a characteristic triglyceride pattern in the 26-54 carbon atoms range. The experimentally determined distributions of the molecular weights of the triglycerides of all milk fats deviated significantly from the distributions predicted by random association of the fatty acids from a single pool.
