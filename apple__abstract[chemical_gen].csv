32182852,"Volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) play an important role in the aroma profile of fermented beverages. However, because of their low concentration in samples, their analysis is difficult. The headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) technique coupled with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is one of the methods successfully used to identify VSCs in wine and beer samples. However, this method encounters more obstacles when spirit beverages are analyzed, as the ethanol content of the matrix decreases the method sensitivity. In this work, different conditions applied during HS-SPME/GC-MS analysis, namely: ethanol concentration, salt addition, time and temperature of extraction, as well as fiber coating, were evaluated in regard to 19 sulfur compounds. The best results were obtained when 50/30 μm Divinylbenzene/Carboxen/Polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) was used to preconcentrate the analytes from the sample at 35 °C for 30 min.

32102431,"Biofortified apples seem to be a suitable produce. In this study, different selenium forms and application levels were applied to the two apple varieties 'Golden Delicious' and 'Jonagold', grown in the years 2017 and 2018 in order to increase the selenium uptake within a typical Western diet. It was shown that the biofortification, which was performed as a foliar application implemented in usual calcium fertilization, led to significantly increased selenium contents in the fruits. Furthermore, biofortification affected the total phenolic content (TPC), the polyphenol oxidase activity (PPO), as well as the antioxidant activity (AOA), the latter measured with the two well-known assays Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity Assay (TEAC) and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity Assays (ORAC). The varying selenium forms and application levels showed a differing influence on the parameters mentioned before. Higher fertilizer levels resulted in higher selenium accumulation. It was found that PPO activity fluctuates less in biofortified apples. With regard to TPC, selenate led to higher amounts when compared to the untreated controls and selenite resulted in lower TPC. AOA analysis showed no clear tendencies as a result of the selenium biofortification. In the case of 'Jonagold', a higher AOA was generally measured when being biofortified, whereas, in the case of 'Golden Delicious', only one form of application led to higher AOA.

32050668,"This is the first study to reveal potential markers for volatile changes during ambient and accelerated shelf life of pasteurized apple juice. The volatile changes were monitored at 20, 30 and 40 °C using a headspace solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry fingerprinting method. Using modern chemometrics and feature selection, hexanal, trans-2-hexenal, dimethyl sulphide, furfural, ethyl acetate and 1-pentanol were chosen as potential shelf life markers. Volatiles associated with the green, grassy and fresh apple aroma, such as hexanal and trans-2-hexenal, decreased during storage, whereas thermal load and browning associated compounds, like dimethyl sulphide and furfural, increased during storage. Hexanal and trans-2-hexenal can be markers to monitor the change in green-apple like character. Furfural and dimethyl sulphide can be markers of temperature abuse during juice processing and storage. Furfural can also be an indicator for juice browning. The present work effectively identified potential markers to monitor and predict volatile aroma changes of shelf stable apple juice in different storage conditions.

We used metabolomics to identify unique compounds from individual foods of a DASH-style diet and determined if these Food-Specific Compounds (FSC) are detectable in urine from participants in a DASH-style dietary study. We also examined relationships between urinary compounds and blood pressure (BP). Nineteen subjects were randomized into 6-week controlled DASH-style diet interventions. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics was performed on 24-hour urine samples collected before and after each intervention and on 12 representative DASH-style foods. Between 66-969 compounds were catalogued as FSC; for example, 4-hydroxydiphenylamine was found to be unique to apple. Overall, 13-190 of these FSC were detected in urine, demonstrating that these unmetabolized food compounds can be discovered in urine using metabolomics. Although linear mixed effects models showed no FSC from the 12 profiled foods were significantly associated with BP, other endogenous and food-related compounds were associated with BP (N = 16) and changes in BP over time (N = 6).

Visual assessment revealed that apple juice pathogenesis-related proteins are able to form haze alone when thermally denatured. These proteins were also able to interact with apple juice procyanidins to form complexes that can be precipitated using ultracentrifugation, even without prior heating.

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were coated with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and complementary double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), which included bio-barcode DNA and thiol-capped DNA. Magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) probes were constructed by modifying the MNPs with ovalbumin-hapten conjugates (OVA-hapten). The target pesticide and OVA-hapten on the surface of the MNP probes competed with the AuNP probes simultaneously, and then the bio-barcode DNA was released for quantification by ddPCR. The concentration of released DNA was inversely proportional to the concentration of pesticide to be tested. Under the optimum conditions, the competitive immunoassay exhibited a wide linear range of 0.01-20 ng/mL and a low detection limit of 0.002 ng/mL.

31514865,"A novel approach for dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction based on the use of deep eutectic solvent as a disperser was presented for the first time. The procedure was automated based on an in-syringe flow system coupled with UV-Vis detection and demonstrated by the determination of chromium (VI) in beverages. This analytical task was used as a proof-of-concept example. The automated extraction procedure involved the aspiration of aqueous sample into a syringe pump with homogeneous mixture of extraction solvent (1-oсtanol) and deep eutectic solvent (tetrabutylammonium bromide - formic acid) containing color-forming reagent (1,5-diphenylcarbazide). This led to decomposition of deep eutectic solvent in aqueous phase resulting in dispersion of extraction solvent, oxidation of 1,5-diphenylcarbazide to 1,5- diphenylcarbazone in the presence of chromium (VI), and formation of colored chromium (III) complex with 1,5-diphenylcarbazone and its fast extraction.

In this study, the effects of intercropping perennial ryegrass and straw mulch on the content, composition and spectral characteristics of soil DOM in orchards in arid and semi-arid areas were investigated by three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Three treatments were applied in a 6-year-old apple orchard on the Loess Plateau: (1) clean tillage (CT); (2) intercropping perennial ryegrass mulch (RE); (3) intercropping straw mulch (CS). Soil samples (0-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80-100 cm) were collected from different treatments. The total soil organic carbon (SOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content were ranked as CS> RE> CT, and decreased with soil depth. In addition, the vertical distribution of DOC with different soil depth was caused by organic matter input but not leaching. Three humic-like components and two protein-like components were identified by EEM-PARAFAC. Fluorescence spectra showed that humic-like compounds were the dominant fractions in soil DOM in the CS treatment. Fluorescence Index (FI) indicated that the proportion of plant residues and soil organic matter derived DOM ranked as CT> RE> CS and gradually decreased with soil depth.

Using in situ immunolocalization and size exclusion epitope detection chromatography, distinct cell type differences in cell wall composition in the exocarp were revealed during apple fruit development. Epidermal cell walls lacked pectic (1→4)-β-d-galactan (associated with rigidity), whereas linear (1→5)-α-l-arabinan (associated with flexibility) was exclusively present in the epidermal cell walls in expanding fruit and then appeared in all cell types during ripening. Branched (1→5)-α-l-arabinan was uniformly distributed between cell types. Laser capture microdissection and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were used to explore transcriptomic differences controlling cell type-specific wall modification. The RNA-seq data indicate that the control of cell wall composition is achieved through cell-specific gene expression of hydrolases. In epidermal cells, this results in the degradation of galactan side chains by possibly five β-galactosidases (BGAL2, BGAL7, BGAL10, BGAL11, and BGAL103) and debranching of arabinans by α-arabinofuranosidases AF1 and AF2.

In this study, we analyzed anthocyanin contents and the expression levels of anthocyanin biosynthetic and regulatory genes in tissue cultured plantlets of two Malus crabapple cultivars following various exogenous melatonin treatments under light and dark conditions. The application of exogenous melatonin not only promoted anthocyanin accumulation in leaves, but also increased the contents of flavonols and proanthocyanins (PAs), via a process that was not dependent on light. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses indicated that the expression of flavonoid biosynthetic genes, flavonoid related transcription factors and melatonin biosynthetic genes was induced by melatonin. We propose that anthocyanin biosynthesis is regulated by melatonin in crabapple leaves via the expression of flavonoid related transcription factors.

Sample preparation approach is rapid and energy efficient, and it requires no pre-concentration before analysis. Validation showed a good analytical performance in terms of specificity, linearity (r2 > 0.999), precision (% RSD < 1.08), recovery (97-100.4%) and sensitivities (limits of detection: 12.48 and 14.95 ng/mL; limit of quantification: 41.61 and 49.85 ng/mL) of PZ and PT, respectively.

31290918,"Understanding the genetic architecture of fruit quality traits is crucial to target breeding of apple ( L.) cultivars. We linked genotype and phenotype information by combining genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) generated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers with fruit flavor volatile data, sugar and acid content, and historical trait data from a gene bank collection. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of apple juice samples, we identified 49 fruit volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We found a very variable content of VOCs, especially for the esters, among 149 apple cultivars. We identified convincing associations for the acetate esters especially butyl acetate and hexyl acetate on chromosome 2 in a region of several alcohol acyl-transferases including AAT1. For sucrose content and for fructose and sucrose in percentage of total sugars, we revealed significant SNP associations. Here, we suggest a vacuolar invertase close to significant SNPs for this association as candidate gene. Harvest date was in strong SNP association with a NAC transcription factor gene and sequencing identified two haplotypes associated with harvest date. The study shows that SNP marker characterization of a gene bank collection can be successfully combined with new and historical trait data for association studies. Suggested candidate genes may contribute to an improved understanding of the genetic basis for important traits and simultaneously provide tools for targeted breeding using marker-assisted selection (MAS).",The plant genome,"['D000085', 'D005638', 'D018745', 'D055106', 'D027845', 'D009812', 'D020641', 'D000073893', 'D013995', 'D055549']","['Acetates', 'Fruit', 'Genome, Plant', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Malus', 'Odorants', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Sugars', 'Time', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']","Genome-Wide Association Studies in Apple Reveal Loci for Aroma Volatiles, Sugar Composition, and Harvest Date.","['Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', None, None]","['analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31290918,2019,0,1,volatiles,apple,0.189873417721519,"['SNP', 'VOCs', 'NAC', 'alcohol', 'nucleotide', 'butyl acetate', 'fructose', 'esters', 'hexyl acetate', 'sucrose', 'acetate esters']",1,15

Development of the method included the study of different sources for ionization, different mobile phases, different extraction conditions as well as different methods of sample preparation. Finally, the single LC-MS/MS method was developed for the analysis of both analytes in one step with a duration of 20 min using a simple single-step extraction. The method with apparent recoveries of 91.4 and 90.4 for acrylamide and HMF, respectively, was applied for the analysis of non-extruded and extruded samples. The obtained results shown that the acrylamide content was <LOD (limit of detection) for all raw materials and non-extruded mixtures, while HMF increased proportionally to the content of added by-products in the mixtures. After the extrusion process, quantification of the acrylamide could be done in all samples. A higher amount of by-products entails higher contents of acrylamide and HMF, with the most significant effect in AP extrudates, where the highest content of HMF (6069 ± 789 ng/g) and acrylamide (5.37 ± 0.50 ng/g) in samples with 15% AP was observed.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D020106', 'D027461', 'D002851', 'D005506', 'D019649', 'D005662', 'D027845', 'D053719', 'D003313']","['Acrylamide', 'Beta vulgaris', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Industry', 'Furaldehyde', 'Malus', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Zea mays']",Simultaneous Determination of Acrylamide and Hydroxymethylfurfural in Extruded Products by LC-MS/MS Method.,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000031', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, 'analogs & derivatives', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121914,2019,0,1,HMF in apple pomace,apple,0.18840579710144928,"['acrylamide', 'hydroxymethylfurfural', '6069', 'AP', 'HMF']",1,13

31119557,"Degradation of the mycotoxin patulin (PAT) and the generation of (less toxic) breakdown products, such as (E/Z)-ascladiol (ASC-E/Z) and desoxypatulinic acid (D-PAT), can occur due to chemical, physical and biological treatments. Our study focused on the chemical degradation of PAT in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA) both for pure PAT standard in acidified aqueous solution and for PAT-contaminated cloudy apple juice (CAJ) (obtained via addition of apple mash produced from apples inoculated with Penicillium expansum). Within this framework, different concentrations of AA were evaluated, as well as the presence/absence of oxygen and different storage temperatures. In order to do so, an in-house methodology allowing a good separation of PAT from its reaction and breakdown products was optimized first. The highest PAT reduction (60%) in CAJ with an initial PAT concentration of 100 μg/kg and 0.25% (w/v) AA was achieved after 6 days of incubation at 22 °C in the presence of oxygen. It was also found that the treatment by AA resulted in the generation of degradation products less toxic than PAT (such as (E/Z)-ASC). In conclusion, AA used to improve numerous product quality aspects (e.g. colour (less browning), nutritional value, etc.) and considered as a safe food additive (Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (1999)) has an effect on PAT degradation. It was shown that such degradation generated less toxic compounds in the presence of oxygen. In view of consumers' safety, fortification of apple juice (and possibly apple-based products) with AA could be helpful within an integrated system to ensure products with low levels of patulin.

For that, four single-stranded DNAs (named linker, trigger, H1 and H2, respectively) are rational designed and T-Hg-T mismatches duplex DNAs as a recognizer combined with the separation of magnetic beads. The design of hybridization chain reaction (HCR) amplification strategy assisted by magnetic separation has been adopted to improve the detection sensitivity. In the presence of pesticides, the amount of the thiol group generated by hydrolysis reaction of acetylcholine (ACh) is reduced, lead to release of less trigger DNA.

31042591,"Patulin (PAT) is a common mycotoxin in fruit products, especially in apples and apple-based products. The European Commission has set maximum levels for PAT in food. Nevertheless, worrying PAT levels were recently recorded in diverse foods across the world. Therefore, a worldwide follow-up of PAT-levels in foods should be considered. Because of PAT's high probability in food products, the toxicological implications for humans need to be addressed as well. Recent studies proved adverse health effects of PAT, such as hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal alterations and inmunotoxicity. In comparison to the toxicity of other mycotoxins such as ochratoxin A, PAT's immunotoxicity can be even more outspoken destructive. In addition, PAT is a low-molecular-weight and highly polar molecule, resulting in many analytical challenges for its detection. As the analytical techniques are continuously improving, PAT determination in multi-mycotoxin analysis has advanced using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) during the last year. Finally, the presence and toxicity of PAT requires a biomarker method to assess its exposure among the population.

These NPs, when compared with ZnO microparticles synthesised with pure phytochemicals (quercetin or sucrose), and water, revealed that sizes and shapes were widely dependent on the organic precursors used. Based on these findings, new insights into the synthesis of ZnO NPs using apple phytochemicals were presented. The photoluminescent properties, characterized by steady-state and time resolve photoluminescence measurements, revealed that besides the intense sharp near-UV band edge emission observed for all particles, with sub-nanosecond lifetime, a strong broad emission band peak at 2.20 eV was detected for microparticles, with longer decay times being associate to crystal defects. Additionally, the photoluminescent properties of ZnO particles, further explored by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), suggested adequacy for imaging applications. The cytotoxicity, evaluated in human dermal fibroblasts, proving the biosafety of ZnO NPs by an unaffected cellular viability, total mitochondrial activity and F-actin cytoskeleton organization, contrasted with some degree of cytotoxicity depicted for microparticles. The influence of the phytochemicals in ZnO cytotoxicity was discussed. To the authors' best knowledge this is the first report of ZnO NPs synthesised with apple extracts.

30911801,"Fizzy extraction (FE) is carried out by first dissolving a carrier gas (typically, carbon dioxide) in a liquid sample at a moderate pressure (typically, 150 kPa) and then rapidly depressurizing the sample. The depressurization leads to instant release of numerous microbubbles in the liquid matrix. The abruptly released gas extracts the volatile solutes and elutes them toward a detector in a short period of time. Here, we describe on-line coupling of FE with gas chromatography (GC). The two platforms are highly compatible and could be combined following several modifications of the interface and adjustments of the extraction sequence. The analytes are released within a short period of time (1.5 s). Thus, the chromatographic peaks are satisfactorily narrow. There is no need to trap the extracted analytes in a loop or on a sorbent, as it is done in standard headspace and microextraction methods. The approach requires only minor sample pretreatment. The main parameters of the FE-GC-mass spectrometry (MS) method were optimized. The results of FE were compared with those of headspace flushing (scavenging headspace vapors), and the enhancement factors were in the order of ~ 2 to 13 (for various analytes). The limits of detection for some of the tested analytes were lower in the proposed FE-GC-MS method than in FE combined with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization MS.

30889479,"Proanthocyanidins (PAs) from plants are a nutritionally valuable component of the human diet and play important roles in defense against pests and diseases. PAs are products of the flavonoid pathway, which also leads to the production of anthocyanins and flavonols. The enzymes leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) and anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) are involved in PA biosynthesis. The PA biosynthetic pathway has been characterized in several plant species, but the relationship between its expression and PA accumulation in Malus crabapple remains unclear. Here, we cloned the LAR genes MrLAR1, 2, and the ANR genes MrANR1, 2, from the red leaved Malus crabapple cultivar 'Royalty'. The contents of PAs and the expression levels of the LAR and ANR genes were investigated in different organs of the two crabapple cultivars. The transcript levels of two LAR genes and two ANR genes correlated with the contents of the catechin and epicatechin, which are proanthocyanidin precursors. Over-expression of the MrLAR1, 2 and MrANR1, 2 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) promoted the accumulation of PAs, while transient silencing of their expression in crabapple resulted in reduced PA levels. In addition, a negative correlation between quercetin, anthocyanin, and PA biosynthesis was also found during crabapple leaf and fruit peel development. We also found that MrLAR1 and 2 may contribute to epicatechin biosynthesis. In summary, the LAR and ANR genes are critical factors in PA biosynthesis, and there is competition between the quercetin, anthocyanin, and PA biosynthetic pathways during leaf and fruit peel development in Malus crabapple.",Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,"['D000872', 'D002392', 'D002851', 'D003001', 'D020869', 'D017343', 'D027845', 'D053858', 'D009247', 'D010940', 'D030821', 'D044945', 'D060888', 'D017422', 'D014026']","['Anthocyanins', 'Catechin', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, Plant', 'Malus', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tobacco']",Identification of leucoanthocyanidin reductase and anthocyanidin reductase genes involved in proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in Malus crabapple plants.,"['Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000201', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, 'Q000096', None, None, None]","['metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'genetics', 'enzymology', 'genetics', 'genetics', 'genetics', None, 'biosynthesis', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30889479,2019,0,0,crab apple,apple,0.16666666666666666,"['anthocyanins', 'epicatechin', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'quercetin', 'catechin', 'anthocyanin', 'flavonols', 'proanthocyanidin', 'PAs']",1,15

This is a powerful tool for evaluating the impact of the production process on the volatomic pattern of fruit juice. A total of 169 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) belonging to different chemical groups were identified. Esters, carbonyl compounds, terpenoids, and alcohols are the major chemical groups in the investigated fruit juices. However, their contribution to the total volatile profile varied. Special attention should be paid to processed fruit juices to avoid the possible deleterious effects associated with the formation of furanic compounds (e.g., heat treatment), since their furanic content was significantly higher in comparison to that of fresh fruit juices. The knowledge obtained in the current study will allow for the introduction of modifications to the process involved in processing juice, which will improve the organoleptic characteristics of processed juices, contributing to a better acceptance by consumers.

30811532,"Allelopathic plants exploit their chemical 'weapons' to prevail over the competition, suppress neighboring plants and consequently use the available resources more efficiently. However, the investigation of plant allelopathic interactions in rhizosphere is difficult to perform because of its high complexity due to interactions of biotic and abiotic factors. Thus, autonomous, aseptic root cultures of apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) could facilitate allelopathic studies. We report on the successful genetic transformation of apple cultivars Melrose, Golden Delicious, Čadel and Gloster using Agrobacterium rhizogenes (Riker et al. 1930) Conn 1942 strain 15834 and for the first time the establishment of apple autonomous and permanent in vitro hairy root cultures that could be used as a new tool for apple allelopathic assays. Molecular characterization of transgenic hairy root lines was conducted to elucidate the possible relationship between expression of T-DNA genes and root growth characteristics that include branching. Similar content of phenolic acids (chlorogenic, caffeic, syringic, p-coumaric and ferulic), glycosilated flavonoids (rutin, quercitrin, isoquercitrin, kaempferol-3-glucoside) and flavonoid aglycones (quercetin and naringenin), and dihydrochalcone phloridzin, was detected in untransformed and transgenic apple root tissue by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (UHPLC/(+/-)HESI-MS/MS) analyses, confirming that genetic transformation did not disturb secondary metabolite production in apple. Chlorogenic and caffeic acids and dihydrochalcones phloridzin and phloretin were detected as putative allelochemicals exuded into the growth medium in which transgenic roots were maintained for 4 weeks. Apple hairy root exudates significantly affected shoot and root development and growth of test plant Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. seedlings after 5 or 10 days of treatment. Additionally, core cell-cycle genes CDKA1;1, CDKB2;1, CYCA3;1 and CYCB2;4 were down regulated in Arabidopsis shoots suggesting, in part, their role in inhibition of shoot growth.

30806167,"Feed control is essential for the safety of animal-origin food. It is estimated that more than 80% of human exposure to dioxins and related compounds comes from the consumption of animal-origin food, and farm animals are exposed to dioxins mainly through the feed. A monitoring programme for dioxins (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs)) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) was conducted in the Polish feed market between 2004 and 2017. Using two complementary ISO 17025-accredited analytical methods (bioassay and high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS)), 2919 samples of plant, animal and minerals origin were analysed. The total number of samples exceeding the maximum limit (ML) was 52, which is 1.8% of all tested samples. They all contained PCDD/Fs in concentrations over the ML, and in 16 samples the limit for the sum of PCDD/F/DL-PCBs was also exceeded. The highest dioxins level was found in feedstuffs derived from Baltic fish; the fish oil was followed by fish meal. Low-chlorinated furans (2.3,7,8 TCDF, 2,3,4,7,8-PCDF and 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDF) were dominant and these congeners accounted for the toxicity expressed in WHO toxic equivalents (WHO-TEQ). In this category, 155 out of the 498 samples (32%) exceeded the action threshold (AT) for PCDD/Fs and in 10 samples (2.0%) for DL-PCBs. Non-compliant fish meals were found in 34 (5.6%) of the tested samples, in 0.7% of compound feeds, and in 1.5% of plant-origin materials. Seven dried plant-derived materials contained PCDD/F level above ML, including alfalfa, maize, apple, basil and beet pulp pellets containing molasses. The dry vegetable materials were mostly contaminated by the 2,3,7,8-furans, the congeners arising from a faulty drying process. No significant time trend can be seen. From the obtained results, it can be concluded that concentrations of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs in Polish feed materials were sufficiently low to ensure low concentrations in animal-derived products.","Food additives & contaminants.

30801944,"Essentials Zymogen PK is activated to PKa and cleaves substrates kininogen and FXII contributing to bradykinin generation. Monomeric PKa and dimeric homologue FXI utilize the N-terminal apple domains to recruit substrates. A high-resolution 1.3 Å structure of full-length PKa reveals an active conformation of the protease and apple domains. The PKa protease and four-apple domain disc organization is 180° rotated compared to FXI. SUMMARY: Background Plasma prekallikrein (PK) and factor XI (FXI) are apple domain-containing serine proteases that when activated to PKa and FXIa cleave substrates kininogen, factor XII, and factor IX, respectively, directing plasma coagulation, bradykinin release, inflammation, and thrombosis pathways. Objective To investigate the three-dimensional structure of full-length PKa and perform a comparison with FXI. Methods A series of recombinant full-length PKa and FXI constructs and variants were developed and the crystal structures determined. Results and conclusions A 1.3 Å structure of full-length PKa reveals the protease domain positioned above a disc-shaped assemblage of four apple domains in an active conformation. A comparison with the homologous FXI structure reveals the intramolecular disulfide and structural differences in the apple 4 domain that prevents dimer formation in PK as opposed to FXI. Two latchlike loops (LL1 and LL2) extend from the PKa protease domain to form interactions with the apple 1 and apple 3 domains, respectively. A major unexpected difference in the PKa structure compared to FXI is the 180° disc rotation of the apple domains relative to the protease domain. This results in a switched configuration of the latch loops such that LL2 interacts and buries portions of the apple 3 domain in the FXI zymogen whereas in PKa LL2 interacts with the apple 1 domain. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry on plasma purified human PK and PKa determined that regions of the apple 3 domain have increased surface exposure in PKa compared to the zymogen PK, suggesting conformational change upon activation.",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,[],[],Plasma kallikrein structure reveals apple domain disc rotated conformation compared to factor XI.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30801944,2020,1,0,"Factor XI, plasma prekallikrein apple domains",apple,0.03571428571428571,"['Hydrogen-deuterium', 'LL1', 'bradykinin']",1,4

The highest response variation was observed in extracts of Granny Smith-an enhancement in flesh and suppression in peel extract. With the dilution, the matrix effect decreased with different magnitudes, but for Granny Smith peel extract an inverted effect was observed. The presence of the matrix effect in GC-MS pesticides analysis was obvious, requiring the application of matrix-matched calibration in quantification procedures for each variety, with calibration standards matched by the matrix concentration.","Journal of environmental science and health.

However, a huge compositional variation is observed between olive oils, requiring the use of diverse analytical techniques for its classification including titration, spectrophotometry and chromatography, as well as sensory analysis. Chemical analysis is usually time-consuming, expensive and require skilled technicians, while the sensorial ones are dependent upon individual subjective evaluations, even if performed by trained panellists. This work evaluated and demonstrated the feasibility of using a potentiometric electronic tongue, comprising non-specific lipid polymeric and cross-sensitive sensor membranes, coupled with chemometric tools based on different sub-sets of sensors (from 11 to 14 sensors), to predict key quality parameters of olive oils based on single-run assays.

PAs were also evaluated in commercial juice and in the juice made in the laboratory by pressing fresh arils. Pomegranate PAs were composed of a very rich mixture of flavan-3-ols: catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and epicatechin gallate. Catechins and gallocatechins were the most abundant units, while galloylated flavanols were detected at lower concentrations. The highest PA content was found in husk (1840.5 μg/g), followed by seeds (316.2 μg/g) and membranes (51.4 μg/g). With regard to the pomegranate edible parts, arils showed concentrations of 34.4 μg/g and pressed aril juice of 21.3 mg/L, lower than those found in other traditional PA-containing food and beverages, such as apple, grapes, chocolate, red wine, or tea. Higher concentrations similar to those found in red wine were observed in commercial whole fruit pressed pomegranate juice (146.9 mg/L). These PA concentrations represented between 0.1 and 7% of the total polyphenol content in the different pomegranate samples, which were richer in ellagitannins and anthocyanins.

These phenolic oxidation products could be responsible of specific organoleptic properties in apple juices and ciders. 5'-O-Caffeoylquinic acid (CQA) is the major hydroxycinnamic acid in apple and the preferential substrate of apple polyphenoloxidase (PPO). Its main oxidation products were synthetized and purified at the multi-milligrams scale to decipher their structures using mass spectrometry. CQA oxidation products were first synthetized in model solution by oxidizing CQA, in the presence of oxygen and PPO.

Camelid variable domains of heavy-chain antibodies (VHHs) show great promise in monitoring environmental chemicals such as pesticides. To improve the rate of success in the generation of VHHs against triazophos, genes specifically encoding VHH fragments from the unique allotype IgG3a of an immunized Camelus bactrianus were amplified by using a pair of novel primers and introduced to construct a diverse VHH library. Five out of seven isolated positive clones, including the VHH T1 with the highest affinity to triazophos, were derived from the allotype IgG3a. A one-step enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using VHH T1 genetically fused with alkaline phosphatase (AP) had a half-maximum inhibition concentration of 6.6 ng/mL for triazophos.

In order to understand the mechanisms involved in scab resistance, we performed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based metabolomics analysis of the cell culture of scab resistant cultivar 'Florina' and scab susceptible cultivar 'Vista Bella' both prior -to and -following treatment with V. inaequalis elicitor (VIE). A total 21 metabolites were identified to be altered significantly in 'Florina' cell cultures upon VIE-treatment. Among 21 metabolites, formation of three new specialized metabolites aucuparin, noraucuparin and eriobofuran were observed only in resistant cultivar 'Florina' after the elicitor treatment. The score plots of principal component analysis (PCA) exhibited clear discrimination between untreated and VIE-treated samples. The alteration in metabolite levels correlated well with the changes in the transcript levels of selected secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes. Aucuparin, noraucuparin and eriobofuran isolated from the 'Florina' cultures showed significant inhibitory effect on the conidial germination of V. inaequalis.

Pesticides were efficiently extracted by magnetic solid-phase extraction based on graphene as sorbent. Response surface methodology was used to assist the multivariable optimization. The perfect chiral separation of the enantiomers was achieved on a Chiralpak IG column within 47 min by reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, which is a significant improvement to resolve a large group of chiral compounds under one set of conditions. The method was validated in terms of selectivity, linearity, sensitivity, trueness and precision, which all satisfy the requirement for pesticides residue analysis.

30322071,"Floral scent is important in plant reproduction and also has aesthetic implications. However, the accurate determination of aroma is presently limited by the available collection and analysis tools. In this study, the floral scents of four crabapple taxa exhibiting faint, weak, clear, and strong scent intensities were comparatively analyzed by electronic nose (E-nose) and gas chromatography⁻mass spectrometry (GC⁻MS). The E-nose was able to effectively group the different taxa in the principal component analysis in correspondence with scent intensity. GC⁻MS analysis identified a total of 60 volatile compounds. The content of nitrogen-containing compounds and aliphatics and the number of unique components of the more aromatic taxa was significantly higher than the less aromatic taxa. α-Cedrene, β-cedrene, 5-methyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one, benzyl alcohol, linalool, and 4-pyrrolidinopyridine contributed significantly to taxon separation. The pattern recognition results confirmed that the E-nose results corroborated the GC⁻MS results. Furthermore, partial least squares regression analysis between the aromatic constituents and sensors indicated that particular sensors were highly sensitive to N-containing compounds, aliphatics, and terpenes.

30298076,"Previous reports regarding rhizodeposits from apple roots are limited, and complicated by microbes, which readily colonize root systems and contribute to modify rhizodeposit metabolite composition. This study delineates methods for collection of apple rhizodeposits under axenic conditions, indicates rootstock genotype-specific differences and validates the contributions of vegetative activity to rhizodeposit quantity. Primary and phenolic rhizodeposit metabolites collected from two apple rootstock genotypes, G935 and M26, were delineated 2 months after root initiation by utilizing gas chromatography/liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/LC-MS), respectively. Twenty-one identified phenolic compounds and 29 sugars, organic acids, and amino acids, as well as compounds tentatively identified as triterpenoids were present in the rhizodeposits. When adjusted for whole plant mass, hexose, erythrose, galactose, phloridzin, kaempferol-3-glucoside, as well as glycerol, and glyceric acid differed between the genotypes. Phloridzin, phloretin, epicatechin, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and chlorogenic acid were among the phenolic compounds found in higher relative concentration in rhizodeposits, as assessed by LC-MS. Among primary metabolites assessed by GC-MS, amino acids, organic acids, and sugar alcohols found in relatively higher concentration in the rhizodeposits included L-asparagine, L-cysteine, malic acid, succinic acid, and sorbitol. In addition, putative ursane triterprenoids, identified based on accurate mass comparison to previously reported triterpenoids from apple peel, were present in rhizodeposits in high abundance relative to phenolic compounds assessed via the same extraction/instrumental method. Validation of metabolite production to tree vegetative activity was conducted using a separate set of micropropagated trees (genotype MM106) which were treated with a toxic volatile compound (butyrolactone) to inhibit activity/kill leaves and vegetative growth. This treatment resulted in a reduction of total collected rhizodeposits relative to an untreated control, indicating active vegetative growth contributes to rhizodeposit metabolites. Culture-based assays indicated an absence of bacterial or fungal endophytes in roots of micropropagated G935 and M26 plants. However, the use of fungi-specific primers in qPCR indicated the presence of fungal DNA in 30% of the samples, thus the contribution of endophytes to rhizodeposits cannot be fully eliminated.

This included refrigerated (4 °C) and non-refrigerated warehouses/environments (30 °C) over 8, 10, 12, and 20 weeks of storage. Apple juice was diluted to 0.010 μg g-1, 0.050 μg g-1, and 0.100 μg g-1 of patulin. SO2 was added to each sample in the amounts of 250 μg mL-1 and 50 μg mL-1. Untreated juice samples for each patulin concentration served as controls under the same experimental conditions. Patulin content was determined with high performance liquid chromatography. The best degradation was observed with 250 μg mL-1 of SO2 at 30 °C regardless of the patulin baseline concentration. Although treatment with SO2 and refrigeration did not fully remove patulin, it was highly efficient over twelve weeks of storage.

Here we studied the nutrikinetics of apple polyphenols by UHPLC-HRMS metabolite fingerprinting, comparing bioavailability when consumed in a natural or a polyphenol-enriched cloudy apple juice. Twelve men and women participated in an acute single blind controlled crossover study in which they consumed 250 mL of cloudy apple juice (CAJ), Crispy Pink apple variety, or 250 mL of the same juice enriched with 750 mg of an apple polyphenol extract (PAJ). Plasma and whole blood were collected at time 0, 1, 2, 3 and 5 h. Urine was collected at time 0 and 0-2, 2-5, 5-8, and 8-24 h after juice consumption. Faecal samples were collected from each individual during the study for 16S rRNA gene profiling. As many as 110 metabolites were significantly elevated following intake of polyphenol enriched cloudy apple juice, with large inter-individual variations. The comparison of the average area under the curve of circulating metabolites in plasma and in urine of volunteers consuming either the CAJ or the PAJ demonstrated a stable metabotype, suggesting that an increase in polyphenol concentration in fruit does not limit their bioavailability upon ingestion. Faecal bacteria were correlated with specific microbial catabolites derived from apple polyphenols. Human metabolism of apple polyphenols is a co-metabolic process between human encoded activities and those of our resident microbiota. Here we have identified specific blood and urine metabolic biomarkers of apple polyphenol intake and identified putative associations with specific genera of faecal bacteria, associations which now need confirmation in specifically designed mechanistic studies.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D000328', 'D001419', 'D001682', 'D015415', 'D002851', 'D018592', 'D004269', 'D005243', 'D005260', 'D005638', 'D000067030', 'D000069196', 'D064368', 'D054884', 'D006801', 'D007558', 'D008297', 'D027845', 'D055432', 'D059808', 'D012336', 'D021521', 'D016037', 'D021241', 'D055815']","['Adult', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Availability', 'Biomarkers', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'DNA, Bacterial', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Fruit', 'Fruit and Vegetable Juices', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Malus', 'Metabolomics', 'Polyphenols', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S', 'Ribotyping', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Young Adult']","Host: Microbiome co-metabolic processing of dietary polyphenols - An acute, single blinded, cross-over study with different doses of apple polyphenols in healthy subjects.","[None, 'Q000145', None, 'Q000097', None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000382', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000008', 'Q000235', None, None, None, None]","[None, 'classification', None, 'blood', None, None, 'genetics', 'microbiology', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'methods', 'administration & dosage', 'genetics', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30131118,2019,0,0,"plasma, blood, urine, feces",apple,0.1,"['polyphenols', 'polyphenol', 'polyphenol extract']",1,8
30105623,"Thermally labile pesticides (captafol, captan, dicofol, and folpet) are highly prone to suffer thermal degradation during sample introduction into a gas chromatograph (GC) to tetrahydrophthalimide (THPI), 4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone (DCBP), and phthalimide (PI), respectively, mainly produced in the glass liner of the injector. This undesired behavior leads to inaccurate qualitative and quantitative results. Direct on-column injection (OCI) technique is evaluated as an alternative to avoid or minimize compound alteration during the analysis. This configuration was studied and evaluated for the determination of this group of thermally troublesome pesticides. The OCI inlet was operated in ""track oven"" temperature and connected to a wide-bore deactivated guard column that is itself connected to a capillary GC analytical column. This technique has demonstrated to be useful for avoiding degradation generated in the hot inlet. Limitations observed for OCI in routine analysis were injection volume, guard column length, and maintenance issues. Analytical standards spiked in vegetable solutions were injected in OCI, not observing any thermal degradation rate. On the contrary, classical splitless injection (SLI) produced high degradation rates in all cases. This OCI approach was validated in citrate QuEChERS extracts of tomato, apple, and orange matrices for these four compounds and their corresponding transformation products (THPI, DCBP, and PI), evaluating recoveries, repeatability, linearity, and matrix effect. This set-up enabled the correct identification and quantitation for most compounds at LOQs of 0.010 mg/kg in fruit and vegetable samples. The OCI grants evident differentiation between metabolites naturally occurring in food and thermal degradation products created during the analysis.

However, the usage of current sample preparation methods is limited by selectivity of the volatiles extraction from the honey matrix and requires significant solvent volume. Therefore, a new sample preparation method based on dehydrating homogeneous liquid⁻liquid extraction (DHLLE) involving reduced solvent usage was developed for screening volatiles and semi-volatiles from the honey. The effective extraction was achieved by implementing a miscible liquid extraction system (aqueous honey solution/isopropanol) followed by separation through dehydration with MgSO₄ and purification by a solvent polarity change and washing. The method was evaluated by estimating accuracy and precision.

The global characterization of the berry fruit metabolome by information dependent acquisition directed LC-MS/MS coupled to a peak mining workflow by isotope pattern matching was reported. Targeted metabolomics analysis of known juice biomarkers, such as flavonoids, anthocyanins, etc. exhibited a good separation of berry fruit juices from adulterant juices. Moreover, untargeted metabolomics analysis was carried out and subjected to chemometrics analysis. Discrimination of blueberry juice, cranberry juice, and its adulterant apple juice and grape juice was obtained by principal component analysis-discriminant analysis. Eighteen characteristic markers discriminating berry fruit juice and its adulterants were selected by comparison of marker abundances in different juice samples.

The new blend was as attractive as the previously identified mixture but is more complex in the number of odorants (six in the old versus ten in the new) and differs significantly in the ratio of three volatiles, 3-methylbutan-1-ol, butyl hexanoate, and dihydro-β-ionone, that are common to both blends and exerted agonist or antagonist effects on behavior in a flight tunnel assay. However, behavioral results with the old and new northern hawthorn blends, as well as modified blends with substituted ratios of 3-methylbutan-1-ol, butyl hexanoate, dihydro-β-ionone, indicated that the 'agonist' or 'antagonist' effects of these volatiles depended on the ratio, or balance of compounds within the blend.

Indeed, the isomerisation 5-CQA → 4-CQA is favoured in resistant cultivars, whereas the isomerisation 5-pCoQA → 4-pCoQA is favoured in susceptible cultivars. As a result, resistant cultivars accumulate higher amounts of 4-CQA than susceptible ones, and the opposite occurs for 4-pCoQA. Also, minor isomerisations of 5-CQA to 1-CQA or 3-CQA show opposite behaviour for resistant and susceptible cultivars. Cultivar resistance to RAA is concluded to be related with the phenylpropanoid pathway, the isomerisation reactions being the key metabolic reaction for a cultivar to be resistant or susceptible to RAA.",Talanta,"['D000818', 'D002851', 'D003373', 'D006430', 'D016018', 'D027845', 'D021241']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Coumaric Acids', 'Hemiptera', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Malus', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",Relationship between hydroxycinnamic acids and the resistance of apple cultivars to rosy apple aphid.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000737', None]","[None, None, 'chemistry', 'drug effects', None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29853055,2018,0,1,phenolic profiles,apple,0.1746031746031746,"['acid', '3-CQA', 'isomerisation 5-CQA → 4-CQA', '→', 'Hydroxycinnamic acids', '4-CQA', '5-CQA', 'phenols', 'ionization-quadrupole', '4-p-coumaroylquinic acid']",1,11

In this study, we describe the sourcing of VR present in food based on chemical analysis of attribution signatures by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) combined with multivariate data analysis. Analytical data was acquired from seven different foods spiked with VR batches that were synthesized via six different routes in two separate laboratories. The synthesis products were spiked at a lethal dose into seven food matrices: water, orange juice, apple purée, baby food, pea purée, liquid eggs and hot dog. After acetonitrile sample extraction, the samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS operated in MRM mode. A multivariate statistical calibration model was built on the chemical attribution profiles from 118 VR spiked food samples. Using the model, an external test-set of the six synthesis routes employed for VR production was correctly identified with no observable major impact of the food matrices to the classification.

In this study, visible⁻near-infrared spectrometry-based reflectance spectral data (350⁻2500 nm) were acquired from 2014, 2015 and 2016 harvest produce after 63 days of storage at 5 °C. Selected spectral features from 2014 season were used to classify the healthy and bitter pit samples from three years. In addition, these spectral features were also validated using hyperspectral imagery data collected on 2016 harvest produce after storage in a commercial storage facility for 5 months. The hyperspectral images were captured from either sides of apples in the range of 550⁻1700 nm. These images were analyzed to extract additional set of spectral features that were effective in bitter pit detection. Based on these features, an automated spatial data analysis algorithm was developed to detect bitter pit points. The pit area was extracted, and logistic regression was used to define the categorizing threshold. This method was able to classify the healthy and bitter pit apples with an accuracy of 85%. Finally, hyperspectral imagery derived spectral features were re-evaluated on the visible⁻near-infrared reflectance data acquired with spectrometer. The pertinent partial least square regression classification accuracies were in the range of 90⁻100%.

29752875,"Antagonistic yeasts suppress plant pathogenic fungi by various mechanisms, but their biocontrol efficacy also depends on the ability to compete and persist in the environment. The goal of the work presented here was to quantify the composition of synthetic yeast communities in order to determine the competitiveness of different species and identify promising candidates for plant protection. For this purpose, colony counting of distinct species and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS; MALDI biotyping) were used to distinguish different yeast species and to quantify the composition of a synthetic community of six yeasts (Aureobasidium pullulans, Candida subhashii, Cyberlindnera sargentensis, Hanseniaspora sp., Metschnikowia pulcherrima and Pichia kluyveri) over time, on apples and in soil, and in different growth media. These studies revealed important characteristics that predispose the different species for particular applications. For example, the competitiveness and antagonistic activity of C. subhashii was strongly increased in the presence of N-acetylglucosamin as the sole carbon source, M. pulcherrima and A. pullulans were the strongest competitors on apple, and C. sargentensis competed the best in soil microcosms. Based on these laboratory studies, M. pulcherrima and A. pullulans are promising candidates for biocontrol applications against fungal phyllosphere diseases, while C. sargentensis may hold potential for use against soilborne fungal pathogens. These results document the potential of MALDI-TOF MS for the quantitative analysis of synthetic yeast communities and highlight the value of studying microorganisms with relevant functions in moderately complex, synthetic communities and natural substrates rather than as individual isolates.","Yeast (Chichester, England)","['D000898', 'D061046', 'D002175', 'D003470', 'D027845', 'D059013', 'D010843', 'D012441', 'D012988', 'D019032', 'D015003']","['Antibiosis', 'Biological Control Agents', 'Candida', 'Culture Media', 'Malus', 'Microbial Consortia', 'Pichia', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Soil Microbiology', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Yeasts']",Characterization of antagonistic yeasts for biocontrol applications on apples or in soil by quantitative analyses of synthetic yeast communities.,"[None, None, 'Q000254', 'Q000737', 'Q000382', None, 'Q000254', 'Q000254', None, None, 'Q000145']","[None, None, 'growth & development', 'chemistry', 'microbiology', None, 'growth & development', 'growth & development', None, None, 'classification']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29752875,2019,0,0,yeast growth,apple,0.039473684210526314,"['carbon', 'M. pulcherrima']",1,3

For 1.5-fold applied dosage, the respective values were determined as 22.42 and 23.64 days, i.e., the degradation of (−)-cyflumetofen was insignificantly favored over that of its enantiomer. Importantly, cyflumetofen was unevenly distributed in apples, with its relative contents in apple peel, peduncle, and pomace equal to 50%, 22%, and 16%, respectively. The proposed method can be used to efficiently separate and quantify chiral pesticide with advantages of a shorter analysis time, greater sensitivity, and better environmental compatibility.

Data concerning content and specific types of flavours is often limited and unknown to users. The aim of the research was to define and compare flavour profiles of e-liquids with the same group taste from different manufacturers. Gas chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) was used to separate and identify 90 popular compounds (98, including isomers) of interest.

29502941,"Non-targeted metabolomic analyses employing nuclear magnetic resonance- and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-based techniques were applied for an in-depth characterization of cabbage vinegar, an original agricultural product made from cabbage harvested in Tsumagoi, Japan. Water-soluble and volatile metabolite profiles of cabbage vinegar were compared with those of various vinegars: rice vinegar, grain vinegar, apple vinegar, and black vinegar (Japanese kurozu made of brown rice). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the water-soluble metabolites indicated that cabbage vinegars belonged to an isolated class by the contributions of fructose, pyroglutamic acid, choline, and methiin (S-methylcysteine sulfoxide). Regarding the volatile compounds, the PCA data represented that rice, black, and apple vinegars were characterized by most of the dominant volatiles, such as acetate esters, alcohols, ketones, and acids. Cabbage and grain vinegars were included in the same class although these two vinegars have different flavors. Orthogonal partial least squares-discrimination analysis exhibited the differences in volatile compound profile between cabbage and grain vinegars, revealing that cabbage vinegars were characterized by the presence of sulfides (dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, and dimethyl trisulfide), nitriles (allyl cyanide and 4-methylthio-butanenitrile), 3-hexene-1-ol, and crotonic acid. The time-course changes in these highlighted compounds during the acetic acid fermentation of cabbage vinegar suggested that pyroglutamic and crotonic acids were produced through fermentation, whereas choline, methiin, sulfides, nitriles, and 3-hexene-1-ol were derived from cabbage, suggesting the key role of these compounds in the unique taste and flavor of cabbage vinegar.",Journal of bioscience and bioengineering,"['D019342', 'D000438', 'D001937', 'D004952', 'D005285', 'D005421', 'D008401', 'D007659', 'D009682', 'D055432', 'D025341', 'D014867']","['Acetic Acid', 'Alcohols', 'Brassica', 'Esters', 'Fermentation', 'Flavoring Agents', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Ketones', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Metabolomics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Water']",Nuclear magnetic resonance- and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-based metabolomic characterization of water-soluble and volatile compound profiles in cabbage vinegar.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'analysis', None, 'methods', None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29502941,2018,1,0,"Cabbage vinegar, apple vinegar",apple,0.20689655172413793,"['sulfides', 'nitriles', 'acetic acid', 'dimethyl sulfide', 'dimethyl disulfide', 'volatile compound', 'choline', 'dimethyl trisulfide', 'alcohols, ketones', 'fructose', 'crotonic acid', 'allyl cyanide', 'acids', 'acetate esters', 'crotonic acids']",1,18

29473913,"The flavoring of vinegars with aromatic fruits and medicinal herbs is a practice with increasing trend mostly in countries with oenological tradition, resulting in a product of improved quality and consumer attractiveness. This study was directed towards the evaluation of the impact of the maceration process on the volatile signature of wine-based aromatic vinegars (WBAVs). The evaluation was performed using solid phase microextraction (SPME) combined with gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Experimental parameters influencing headspace solid (HS)-SPME extraction efficiency, were optimized using an univariate experimental design. The best results were achieved using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber, 10 mL of vinegar sample, at 50 °C for 30 min of extraction. This way One hundred and three volatile organic compounds (VOCs), belonging to different chemical families including ethyl esters (37), higher alcohols (20), fatty acids (10), terpenoids (23), carbonyl compounds (six), lactones (five) and volatile phenols (two), were identified in wine vinegar (control) and WBAV. As far as we know, 34 of these VOCs are reported for the first time in macerated vinegars. Higher alcohols and lactones are the major chemical families in WBAV macerated with apple, whereas terpenoids are predominant in WBAV macerated with banana. The obtained data represent a suitable tool to guarantee the authenticity and genuineness of WBAV, as well as to promote the production of WBAV with improved sensorial and organoleptic properties. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reported studies dealing with the volatile signature of WBAV enriched with banana, passion fruit, apple and pennyroyal.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","['D019342', 'D008401', 'D009994', 'D052617', 'D013696', 'D055549', 'D014920']","['Acetic Acid', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Solid Phase Microextraction', 'Temperature', 'Volatile Organic Compounds', 'Wine']",Establishment of the Volatile Signature of Wine-Based Aromatic Vinegars Subjected to Maceration.,"['Q000737', None, None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['chemistry', None, None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29473913,2018,0,0,wines,apple,0.1518987341772152,"['wine-based aromatic vinegars', 'alcohols', 'fatty acids', 'carbonyl', 'WBAV', 'ethyl esters', 'aromatic fruits', 'volatile phenols', 'terpenoids', 'wine vinegar']",1,12
29455078,"In the present study, we report a highly sensitive, rapid and low cost colorimetric monitoring of malathion (an organophosphate insecticide) employing a basic hexapeptide, malathion specific aptamer (oligonucleotide) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as a nanoprobe. AgNPs are made to interact with the aptamer and peptide to give different optical responses depending upon the presence or absence of malathion. The nanoparticles remain yellow in color in the absence of malathion owing to the binding of aptamer with peptide which otherwise tends to aggregate the particles because of charge based interactions. In the presence of malathion, the agglomeration of the particles occurs which turns the solution orange. Furthermore, the developed aptasensor was successfully applied to detect malathion in various water samples and apple. The detection offered high recoveries in the range of 89-120% with the relative standard deviation within 2.98-4.78%. The proposed methodology exhibited excellent selectivity and a very low limit of detection i.e. 0.5pM was achieved. The developed facile, rapid and low cost silver nanoprobe based on aptamer and peptide proved to be potentially applicable for highly selective and sensitive colorimetric sensing of trace levels of malathion in complex environmental samples.","Spectrochimica acta.

29433266,"The aim of this study was to characterize the flavor profiles of 14 commercial apple ciders from the United Kingdom and Scandinavian region. The flavor properties were established by sensory profiling and analysis of volatile and non-volatile components, including titratable acidity, pH, residual sugars and organic acids. A total of 72 volatile compounds were identified in the 14 apple ciders using dynamic headspace sampling (DHS) coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The main volatile compounds found in apple ciders were esters and higher alcohols, followed by aldehydes and fatty acids. Sensory characterizations of the aroma and taste of apple ciders were carried out by a trained sensory panel using descriptive analysis with 23 sensory attributes. The attributes apple, cooked apple, yeasty, sweet and sour were the most predominant sensory descriptors used to describe the similarities and differences in the samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that floral and fruity (fresh apple, banana and pear) odors were highly associated with sweet taste and opposed to the more complex aroma attributes (yeasty, lactic, chemical, mouldy, black pepper and earthy) and sour taste. Most of the UK apple ciders were characterized by these complex odors and taste notes sour, astringent and bitter, whereas ciders from the Scandinavian region had diverse sensory profiles. Partial least squares regression (PLS) based on the sensory and chemical data was able to cluster the ciders according to differences in production methods (oak-aged or spontaneous fermentation; controlled malolactic fermentation; industrial production with flavor modifications). Moreover, this study also suggested that ciders with marked levels of acetate esters were characterized by cooked/fresh apple, citrus and tropical fruit odors.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","['D000143', 'D000328', 'D000434', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D006801', 'D006863', 'D027845', 'D008875', 'D009812', 'D055696', 'D012537', 'D012903', 'D000073893', 'D013649', 'D055697', 'D006113', 'D055549']","['Acids', 'Adult', 'Alcoholic Beverages', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Malus', 'Middle Aged', 'Odorants', 'Olfactory Perception', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries', 'Smell', 'Sugars', 'Taste', 'Taste Perception', 'United Kingdom', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Flavor profiling of apple ciders from the UK and Scandinavian region.,"['Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29433266,2019,0,1,flavor profiles of apple ciders,apple,0.07339449541284404,"['alcohols', 'fatty acids', 'aldehydes', 'cooked/fresh apple, citrus and tropical fruit', 'esters', 'headspace', 'acids', 'acetate esters']",1,8
29430599,"Phenolic resin based activated carbon fibers (ACFs) were applied for the first time as a reversed-dispersive solid-phase extraction (r-DSPE) sorbent. A modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method was applied to determine 26 pesticides (organophosphates, organochlorines, synthetic pyrethroids, and herbicides) in different complex matrices, including cauliflower, cucumber, banana, apple, wheat, and black gram. Different physicochemical characterization techniques were used to investigate the engineering and structural properties of the r-DSPE sorbent. All the chromatographic analyses were performed with a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector. The recoveries of all 26 pesticides were acceptable (70-120%), with relative standard deviations of less than 15%. The limit of detection and the limit of quantification were 1.13-5.48 ng/g and 3.42-16.60 ng/g, respectively. In the original QuEChERS method, primary secondary amine is extensively used as the r-DSPE sorbent in the cleanup process, but it is eightfold more expensive than the ACFs used in this study. Therefore, the modified QuEChERS method using ACFs during the cleanup process is more efficient, cheaper, and more robust to determine pesticides from different types of matrices, including vegetables, grains, and fruits, and ACFs could be used as a cost-effective alternative to primary secondary amine.

With the intent to determine minimal fit-for-purpose sample size, analyses were conducted for up to 93 incurred and added pesticide residues in 10 common fruits and vegetables processed using different sample comminution equipment. The commodities studied consisted of apple, banana, broccoli, celery, grape, green bean, peach, potato, orange, and squash. A Blixer® was used to chop the bulk samples at room temperature, and test portions of 15, 10, 5, 2, and 1 g were taken for analysis (n = 4 each). Additionally, 40 g subsamples (after freezing) were further comminuted using a cryomill device with liquid nitrogen, and test portions of 5, 2, and 1 g were analyzed (n = 4 each). Both low-pressure gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LPGC-MS/MS) and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-MS/MS were used for analysis. An empirical approach was followed to isolate and estimate the measurement uncertainty contribution of each step in the overall method by adding quality control spikes prior to each step. Addition of an internal standard during extraction normalized the sample preparation step to 0% error contribution, and coefficients of variation (CVs) were 6-7% for the analytical steps (LC and GC) and 6-9% for the sample processing techniques. In practice, overall CVs averaged 9-11% among the different analytes, commodities, batches, test portion weights, and analytical and sample processing methods.

29378358,"Coagulation factor XI is activated by thrombin or factor XIIa resulting in a conformational change that converts the catalytic domain into its active form and exposing exosites for factor IX on the apple domains. Although crystal structures of the zymogen factor XI and the catalytic domain of the protease are available, the structure of the apple domains and hence the interactions with the catalytic domain in factor XIa are unknown. We now used chemical footprinting to identify lysine residue containing regions that undergo a conformational change following activation of factor XI. To this end, we employed tandem mass tag in conjunction with mass spectrometry. Fifty-two unique peptides were identified, covering 37 of the 41 lysine residues present in factor XI. Two identified lysine residues that showed altered flexibility upon activation were mutated to study their contribution in factor XI stability or enzymatic activity. Lys357, part of the connecting loop between A4 and the catalytic domain, was more reactive in factor XIa but mutation of this lysine residue did not impact on factor XIa activity. Lys516 and its possible interactor Glu380 are located in the catalytic domain and are covered by the activation loop of factor XIa. Mutating Glu380 enhanced Arg369 cleavage and thrombin generation in plasma. In conclusion, we have identified novel regions that undergo a conformational change following activation.

29232626,"The anti-hyperlipidemic effects of crude crabapple extracts derived from Malus 'Red jade', Malus hupehensis (Pamp.) Rehd. and Malus prunifolia (Willd.) Borkh. were evaluated on high-fat diet induced obese (HF DIO) mice. The results revealed that some of these extracts could lower serum cholesterol levels in HF DIO mice. The same extracts were also parallelly analyzed by LC-MS in both positive and negative ionization modes. Based on the pharmacological results, 22 LC-MS variables were identified to be correlated with the anti-hyperlipidemic effects using partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and independent samples t-test. Further, under the guidance of the bioactivity-correlated LC-MS signals, 10 compounds were targetedly isolated and enriched using UPLC-DAD-MS-SPE and identified/elucidated by NMR together with MS/MS as citric acid(1), p-coumaric acid(2), hyperoside(3), myricetin(4), naringenin(5), quercetin(6), kaempferol(7), gentiopicroside(8), ursolic acid(9) and 8-epiloganic acid(10). Among these 10 compounds, 6 compounds, hyperoside(3), myricetin(4), naringenin(5), quercetin(6), kaempferol(7) and ursolic acid(9), were individually studied and reported to indeed have effects on lowering the serum lipid levels.

The mixtures followed a raw material to NovoGro ratio of 50:1. The pellets diameters varied between 4 and 5 mm, and the average length was 20 mm. The dog manure, horse manure, apple pomace waste and tea waste pellets were denoted as DN, HN, AN and TN, respectively. The combustion characteristics of the pelletized fuels were investigated, such as total moisture, ash content, calorific value and ash fusion point, etc. The physicochemical properties were analyzed by using a number of analytical techniques including X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF), X-ray diffraction spectrometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results of the mechanical, thermal and morphological properties show that the raw materials were effectively combined with the NovoGro binder; furthermore, the DN, HN and TN pellets exhibited excellent mechanical and thermal properties, including high calorific values (>16.30 MJ/kg), high resistance to mechanical shock (>99%), high volatile matter contents, optimal softening temperatures and optimal ash contents. However, the high K, Ca, and Si contents of the AN can form low-melting-point eutectics, which can cause slagging. Moreover, the AN materials had large particle sizes, and high cellulose and hemicellulose contents led to high total moistures, low softening temperatures and low calorific values.

In the case of the cryomill, test portions were 2, 1, and 0.5 g and all subsamples in all cases entailed five replicates. Determined concentrations and precisions (CV) of the analytes were compared to assess possible differences in systematic and random forms of error. A quality control spike was made before each step in the procedures to isolate that individual step in the uncertainty measurements using the error propagation sum of squares approach. Results indicated that the uncertainty of the sample preparation and LPGC-MS/MS analysis steps were 2-7 and 11% CV, respectively, while uncertainties of sample processing ranged from 6% CV for the cryomill to 12% CV for the ambient Blixer conditions. The common use of internal standards reduced overall method uncertainty from 12-15 to 7-10% CV.

The developed bespoke polymer demonstrates a quantitative binding towards the patulin present in undiluted apple juice. The polymer is inexpensive and easy to mass-produce. The contributing factors to the function of the adsorbent is a combination of acidic and basic functional monomers producing a zwitterionic complex in the solution that formed stronger binding complexes with the patulin molecule.

29027463,"Gas chromatography/olfactometry (GC/O) has been used in various fields as a valuable method to identify odor-active components from a complex mixture. Since human assessors are employed as detectors to obtain the olfactory perception of separated odorants, the GC/O technique is limited by its subjectivity, variability, and high cost of the trained panelists. Here, we present a proof-of-concept model by which odor information can be obtained by machine-learning-based prediction from molecular parameters (MPs) of odorant molecules. The odor prediction models were established using a database of flavors and fragrances including 1026 odorants and corresponding verbal odor descriptors (ODs). Physicochemical parameters of the odorant molecules were acquired by use of molecular calculation software (DRAGON). Ten representative ODs were selected to build the prediction models based on their high frequency of occurrence in the database. The features of the MPs were extracted via either unsupervised (principal component analysis) or supervised (Boruta, BR) approaches and then used as input to calibrate machine-learning models. Predictions were performed by various machine-learning approaches such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and extreme learning machine. All models were optimized via parameter tuning and their prediction accuracies were compared. A SVM model combined with feature extraction by BR-C (confirmed only) was found to afford the best results with an accuracy of 97.08%. Validation of the models was verified by using the GC/O data of an apple sample for comparison between the predicted and measured results. The prediction models can be used as an auxiliary tool in the existing GC/O by suggesting possible OD candidates to the panelists and thus helping to give more objective and correct judgment.

Nicotianamine (NA) is known to play an important role in Fe transport and endogenous hormone balance. In the present study, we investigated the role of a nicotianamine synthase 1 gene (MxNas1) in an apple species, Malus xiaojinensis, that has a more Fe-efficient genotype than other apple species and ecotypes. To characterise the response of M. xiaojinensis to Fe deficiency, we used quantitative Q-PCR to determine the level of expression of MxNas1 and Western blot to measure protein levels. Immunohistochemical staining and GFP fluorescence localisation of the MxNAS1 protein were also carried out. HPLC and polarised absorption spectrophotometry were performed to investigate the effects of overexpression of MxNas1 in order to elucidate the role of MxNAS1 in the cellular uptake of active Fe in tobacco suspension cells. We found that MxNas1 expression and protein levels were higher under Fe deficiency stress than under Fe sufficiency. Immunohistochemical staining showed that MxNAS1 was localised mainly in the epidermal and vascular tissues of the roots, vascular tissues of the stem and palisade cells of mature leaves, and in parenchyma cells of young leaves. MxNAS1 was mainly localised in the plasma membranes and vesicles of protoplasts. In addition, overexpression of MxNas1 in stable transgenic tobacco cells increased NA and active Fe content under Fe sufficiency. The results suggest that MxNas1 expression in M. xiaojinensis is induced in response to Fe deficiency stress, resulting in higher levels of the protein.

28738556,"A new sample preparation method based on liquid-liquid-liquid extraction combined with dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction followed by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection has been reported for the extraction/preconcentration and determination of trace levels of twelve pesticide residues from different samples with high content of solids without filtration. This method consists of a three-phase system including an aqueous phase (sample solution), acetonitrile, and hexane. The extraction mechanism is based on different affinities of the substances from the sample matrices towards each of the involved phase, which provides a high selectivity to the process. In other words, interfering hydrophobic compounds are transferred into hexane and will not be present in the final extract. Furthermore, ionic and polar compounds are retained in the aqueous phase. Therefore, only semi-polar compounds such as the studied pesticides are extracted into acetonitrile. In this method, a homogeneous solution of the aqueous phase and acetonitrile (a water-soluble extraction solvent) forms two clearly separated phases in the presence of sodium sulfate (as a phase separation agent) and simultaneously the analytes are extracted into the fine droplets of the acetonitrile collected on the surface of the aqueous phase. To achieve high enrichment factors, the acetonitrile phase is mixed with 1,2-dibromoethane (as a preconcentration solvent) at µL-level to perform the following dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction procedure. Several parameters that can affect extraction efficiency including kind and volume of extraction solvent, type and concentration of phase separation agent, hexane volume, kind of preconcentration solvent, and ionic strength were studied and optimized.

Here, the physiological and phosphoproteomic responses of drought-sensitive genotype (M26) and drought-tolerant genotype (MBB) under moderate drought stress were investigated. Our results of the physiology analysis indicated that the MBB genotype could produce more osmosis-regulating substances. Furthermore, phosphoproteins from leaves of both genotypes under moderate drought stress were analyzed using the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification technology. A total of 595 unique phosphopeptides, 682 phosphorylated sites, and 446 phosphoproteins were quantitatively analyzed in the two genotypes. Five and thirty-five phosphoproteins with the phosphorylation levels significantly changed (PLSC) were identified in M26 and MBB, respectively. Among these, four PLSC phosphoproteins were common to both genotypes, perhaps indicating a partial overlap of the mechanisms to moderate drought stress. Gene ontology analyses revealed that the PLSC phosphoproteins represent a unique combination of metabolism, transcription, translation, and protein processing, suggesting that the response in apple to moderate drought stress encompasses a new and unique homeostasis of major cellular processes. The basic trend was an increase in protein and organic molecules abundance related to drought. These increases were higher in MBB than in M26.

28636152,"Several herbivorous insects and plant-associated microorganisms control the phytohormonal balance, thus enabling them to successfully exploit the plant by inhibiting plant defenses and withdrawing plant resources for their own benefit. The leaf-mining moth Phyllonorycter blancardella modifies the cytokinin (CK) profile of mined leaf-tissues, and the insect symbiotic bacteria Wolbachia is involved in the plant manipulation to the benefit of the insect host. To gain a deeper understanding into the possible origin and dynamics of CKs, we conducted an extensive characterization of CKs in larvae and in infected apple leaves. Our results show the enhanced CK levels in mines, both on green and yellow leaves, allowing insects to control their nutritional supply under fluctuating environmental conditions. The spatial distribution of CKs within the mined leaves shows that hormone manipulation is strictly limited to the mine suggesting the absence of CK translocation from distant leaf areas toward the insect feeding site. Mass spectrometry analyses reveal that major CK types accumulating in mines and larvae are similar to what is observed for most gall-inducers, suggesting that strategies underlying the plant manipulation may be shared between herbivorous insects with distinct life histories. Results further show that CKs are detected in the highest levels in larvae, reinforcing our hypothesis that CKs accumulating in the mines originate from the insect itself. Presence of bacteria-specific methylthio-CKs is consistent with previous results suggesting that insect bacterial symbionts contribute to the observed phenotype. Our study provides key findings toward the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying this intricate plant-insect-microbe interaction.",Insect science,"['D000818', 'D003583', 'D006790', 'D007814', 'D027845', 'D009036', 'D018515']","['Animals', 'Cytokinins', 'Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Larva', 'Malus', 'Moths', 'Plant Leaves']",Dynamics and origin of cytokinins involved in plant manipulation by a leaf-mining insect.,"[None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000502', 'Q000378', 'Q000502', 'Q000378']","[None, 'metabolism', None, 'physiology', 'metabolism', 'physiology', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28636152,2017,0,0,Infected apple leaves,apple,0.021505376344086023,"['herbivorous', 'cytokinin']",1,2

28518086,"Proton Transfer Reaction (PTR), combined with a Time-of-Flight (ToF) Mass Spectrometer (MS) is an analytical approach based on chemical ionization that belongs to the Direct-Injection Mass Spectrometric (DIMS) technologies. These techniques allow the rapid determination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), assuring high sensitivity and accuracy. In general, PTR-MS requires neither sample preparation nor sample destruction, allowing real time and non-invasive analysis of samples. PTR-MS are exploited in many fields, from environmental and atmospheric chemistry to medical and biological sciences. More recently, we developed a methodology based on coupling PTR-ToF-MS with an automated sampler and tailored data analysis tools, to increase the degree of automation and, consequently, to enhance the potential of the technique. This approach allowed us to monitor bioprocesses (e.g. enzymatic oxidation, alcoholic fermentation), to screen large sample sets (e.g. different origins, entire germoplasms) and to analyze several experimental modes (e.g. different concentrations of a given ingredient, different intensities of a specific technological parameter) in terms of VOC content. Here, we report the experimental protocols exemplifying different possible applications of our methodology: i.e. the detection of VOCs released during lactic acid fermentation of yogurt (on-line bioprocess monitoring), the monitoring of VOCs associated with different apple cultivars (large-scale screening), and the in vivo study of retronasal VOC release during coffee drinking (nosespace analysis).",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,"['D001331', 'D003069', 'D005285', 'D005504', 'D005838', 'D006801', 'D019344', 'D027845', 'D013058', 'D009296', 'D011522', 'D055549', 'D015014']","['Automation', 'Coffee', 'Fermentation', 'Food Analysis', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Lactic Acid', 'Malus', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Nasal Cavity', 'Protons', 'Volatile Organic Compounds', 'Yogurt']","PTR-ToF-MS Coupled with an Automated Sampling System and Tailored Data Analysis for Food Studies: Bioprocess Monitoring, Screening and Nose-space Analysis.","[None, None, None, 'Q000295', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000235', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, 'instrumentation', None, None, 'analysis', 'genetics', 'methods', 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28518086,2018,0,1,volatiles,apple,0.0821917808219178,"['VOCs', 'lactic acid', 'VOC', 'nosespace', 'volatile organic']",1,6

28454713,"Apple ring rot, caused by Botryosphaeria dothidea, is a serious apple disease in China. Bacillus subtilis 9407 was isolated from healthy apples and showed strong antifungal activity against B. dothidea. To identify the primary antifungal compound of B. subtilis 9407 and determine its role in controlling apple ring rot, a transposon mutant library was constructed using TnYLB-1, and a mutant completely defective in antifungal activity was obtained. The gene inactivated in the antifungal activity mutant had 98.5% similarity to ppsB in B. subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168, which encodes one of the five synthetases responsible for synthesizing fengycin. A markerless ppsB deletion mutant was constructed. Compared with the wild-type strain, lipopeptide crude extracts from ΔppsB showed almost no inhibition of B. dothidea mycelial growth. Furthermore, fengycin-like lipopeptides (retention factor 0.1-0.2) that exhibited antifungal activity against B. dothidea were observed in the wild-type strain by thin-layer chromatography (TLC)-bioautography analysis, but not in ΔppsB. Semipreparative reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) detection revealed that ΔppsB lost the ability to synthesize fengycin. These results suggest that ppsB is responsible for synthesizing fengycin and that fengycin is the major antifungal compound produced by B. subtilis 9407 against B. dothidea. Moreover, a biocontrol assay showed that the control efficacy of ΔppsB was reduced by half compared with the wild-type strain, indicating that fengycin plays a major role in controlling apple ring rot disease.

28437164,"This study investigated factors that may contribute to the presence of arsenic and other heavy metals in apple and grape juices processed with filter aids. Different types and grades of filter aids were analyzed for arsenic, lead, and cadmium with inductively coupled plasma-tandem mass spectrometry. Potential factors affecting the transfer of heavy metals to juices during filtration treatments were evaluated. Effects of washing treatments on removal of heavy metals from filter aids were also determined. Results showed that diatomaceous earth (DE) generally contained a higher level of arsenic than perlite, whereas perlite had a higher lead content than DE. Cellulose contained the lowest level of arsenic among the surveyed filter aids. All samples of food-grade filter aids contained arsenic and lead levels that were below the U.S. Pharmacopeia and National Formulary limits of 10 ppm of total leachable arsenic and lead for food-grade DE filter aids. Two samples of arsenic-rich (>3 ppm) food-grade filter aids raised the level of arsenic in apple and grape juices during laboratory-scale filtration treatments, whereas three samples of low-arsenic (<1 ppm) food-grade filter aids did not affect arsenic levels in filtered juices. Filtration tests with simulated juices (pH 2.9 to 4.1, Brix [°Bx] 8.2 to 18.1, total suspended solids [TSS] 0.1 to 0.5%) showed that pH or sugar content had no effect on arsenic levels of filtered juices, whereas arsenic content of filtered juice was elevated when higher amounts of filter aid were used for filtration. Authentic unfiltered apple juice (pH 3.6, °Bx 12.9, TSS 0.4%) and grape juice (pH 3.3, °Bx 16.2, TSS 0.05%) were used to verify results obtained with simulated juices.

The main reason for this change was the negative impact on the single stage GC-MS analysis caused by the interference from coeluting matrix compounds. The new development of gas chromatography coupled to high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (GC-HRAMS) provides opportunities to overcome such matrix interferences as a result of its much higher selectivity; allowing laboratories to carry out full-scan analysis covering the most exigent analytical performance criteria. The aim of this work is the evaluation of the main analytical performance parameters for the multiresidue screening of pesticide residues by a gas chromatography-Orbitrap™ mass spectrometer in fruits and vegetables. Electron ionization and full-scan high resolution mass spectrometry was selected for this evaluation. Mass resolving power, selectivity, sensitivity, analyte identification and database generation are discussed in light of the analysis of various commodities and a large scope of pesticides. The selected operational conditions provided optimal mass accuracy, within ±1mDa and achieved LOQs of 10μg/kg or lower for practically all the selected pesticides and commodities.

28402234,"In contrast with vitellogenin maturation, it is unknown whether gastropod perivitellin precursors are subject to large structural changes. The gastropod reproductive tract includes an accessory organ, the albumen gland (AG), that produces and secretes perivitelline fluid. In the apple snail Pomacea canaliculata, the large, reddish-pink AG provides eggs with perivitellins that are defensive against predators. Although the AG makes a considerable contribution to apple snail biomass, field observations indicate that it is rejected by avian and mammalian predators, although the underlying reason remains unknown. By analyzing the structure-function properties of P. canaliculata perivitellin precursors, we provide insight into perivitellin maturation and its relationship with apple snail predator feeding behavior. Structural analysis using small-angle X-ray scattering, absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism, electrophoresis, chromatography, and partial proteolysis showed that the size, shape, and structure of perivitellin precursors resemble those of egg mature forms. Functional analysis indicates that the precursors of the defensive perivitellins ovorubin (PcOvo) and perivitellin-2 (PcPV2) are highly stable and antinutritive, withstanding proteinase digestion and displaying structural stability of their quaternary structure under a wide pH range (4.0-10.0). Furthermore, AG extracts limit a predator's ability to digest nutrients and are toxic to mice (median lethal concentration 96 h after administration: 5.9 mg/kg). Treated mice displayed neurologic signs similar to those produced by egg PcPV2. Results indicate that apple snails store active precursors of egg proteins inside the AG, providing evidence that gastropod perivitellin precursors do not experience the large structural processing of invertebrate vitellogenin maturation. These defensive proteins provide the apple snail AG with neurotoxic, antinutritive, and antidigestive activity, a likely explanation for the predators' feeding behavior.",Physiological and biochemical zoology : PBZ,"['D000818', 'D001826', 'D004527', 'D006863', 'D010063', 'D011235', 'D012908']","['Animals', 'Body Fluids', 'Egg Proteins', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Ovum', 'Predatory Behavior', 'Snails']",Apple Snail Perivitellin Precursor Properties Help Explain Predators' Feeding Behavior.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000502']","[None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, 'physiology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28402234,2017,0,0,apple snail,apple,0.0625,"['AG', 'perivitellins']",1,6

Our aim was to develop, validate and evaluate an analytical method for the separation, identification and quantification of monomeric and oligomeric flavanols in apple extracts. To achieve this, we prepared two types of flavanol extracts from freeze-dried apples; one was an epicatechin-rich extract containing ∼30% (w/w) monomeric (-)-epicatechin which also contained oligomeric procyanidins (Extract A), the second was an oligomeric procyanidin-rich extract depleted of epicatechin (Extract B). The parameters considered for method optimisation were HPLC columns and conditions, sample heating, mass of extract and dilution volumes. The performance characteristics considered for method validation included standard linearity, method sensitivity, precision and trueness. Eight laboratories participated in the method evaluation. Chromatographic separation of the analytes was best achieved utilizing a Hilic column with a binary mobile phase consisting of acidic acetonitrile and acidic aqueous methanol.

The analysis results showed that fluorescence spectrometry can be used to detect and predict the chlorothalonil residue in fruit juice, and the performance of established exponential function model was better than the linear function model. At the same time, derivative fluorescence spectrometry method was found to have no significant advantage in the concentration prediction model of chlorothalonil residue in fruit juice, so the original fluorescence spectrum can be directly applied in the modeling analysis.",Guang pu xue yu guang pu fen xi = Guang pu,"['D005638', 'D000067030', 'D009570', 'D010573', 'D013050']","['Fruit', 'Fruit and Vegetable Juices', 'Nitriles', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",Research on Detection and Modeling of Chlorothalonil Pesticide Residue in Typical Fruit Juice with Fluorescence Spectrometry.,"[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30148577,2018,0,0,pesticide detection,apple,0.09836065573770492,"['chlorothalonil residue in fruit juice', 'chlorothalonil']",1,6

27896554,"This study investigated the volatile emission from apple (Malus x domestica Borkh., cv. Golden Delicious) foliage that was either intact, mechanically-damaged, or exposed to larval feeding by Pandemis heparana (Denis and Schiffermüller) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). Volatiles were collected by closed-loop-stripping-analysis and characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in three time periods: after 1 h and again 24 and 48 h later. Volatiles for all treatments also were monitored continuously over a 72-h period by the use of proton transfer reaction - time of flight-mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS). In addition, the volatile samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) using male and female antennae of P. heparana. Twelve compounds were detected from intact foliage compared with 23 from mechanically-damaged, and 30 from P. heparana-infested foliage. Interestingly, six compounds were released only by P. heparana-infested foliage. The emission dynamics of many compounds measured by PTR-ToF-MS showed striking differences according to the timing of herbivory and the circadian cycle. For example, the emission of green leaf volatiles began shortly after the start of herbivory, and increased over time independently from the light-dark cycle. Conversely, the emission of terpenes and aromatic compounds showed a several-hour delay in response to herbivory, and followed a diurnal rhythm. Methanol was the only identified volatile showing a nocturnal rhythm. Consistent GC-EAD responses were found for sixteen compounds, including five aromatic ones. A field trial in Sweden demonstrated that benzyl alcohol, 2-phenylethanol, phenylacetonitrile, and indole lures placed in traps were not attractive to Pandemis spp. adults, but 2-phenylethanol and phenylacetonitrile when used in combination with acetic acid were attractive to both sexes.",Journal of chemical ecology,"['D000818', 'D005260', 'D008401', 'D060434', 'D007814', 'D007915', 'D008297', 'D027845', 'D018515', 'D055549']","['Animals', 'Female', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Herbivory', 'Larva', 'Lepidoptera', 'Male', 'Malus', 'Plant Leaves', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']","Emission of Volatile Compounds from Apple Plants Infested with Pandemis heparana Larvae, Antennal Response of Conspecific Adults, and Preliminary Field Trial.","[None, None, None, None, 'Q000502', 'Q000502', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, None, 'physiology', 'physiology', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27896554,2017,0,1,volatiles of infested apple,apple,0.09090909090909091,"['acetic acid', 'green leaf volatiles', 'Methanol', 'terpenes', 'indole lures', 'benzyl alcohol', '2-phenylethanol']",1,8
27890695,"Nitric oxide (NO) and polyamines (PAs) belong to plant growth and development regulators. These compounds play a key role in numerous physiological processes e.g. seed germination. Based on the suggestion of overlapping of NO and PAs biosynthetic pathways, we demonstrated a cross-talk of NO and PAs in regulation of embryonic dormancy release. The aim of the work was to investigate an impact of PAs (Put, Spd and Spm) or NO short-term fumigation on nitrite, urea, Arg and ornithine (Orn) content, NO synthase-like (NOS-like) and arginase activity in axes of apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) embryos during dormancy alleviation and at the stage of termination of germination sensu stricto. NO, Put/Spd induced dormancy breakage and germination of apple embryos corresponded to stimulation of urea cycle and high free Arg pool in seedlings roots. After two days of the culture Put and Spd stimulated Arg dependent NO formation, inhibition of which was observed after Spm application. Put or Spd application as well as NO short-term pretreatment of apple embryos influenced level of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Higher abundance of such modified proteins correlated well to the declined content of nitrated proteins, suggesting their important role in regulation of embryo germination. NO led to stimulation of embryos germination by increasing level of free PAs (mostly Put). While transcriptomic approach showed down regulation of Spm synthesis and up-regulation of Spm degradation by NO, confirming negative role of Spm over-accumulation in embryo dormancy removal.

27881725,"Intraspecific genetic variation is essential for the responses and adaption of plants to evolutionary challenges, such as changing environmental conditions. The development of the Earth's aerobic atmosphere has increased the demand for iron (Fe) in organisms, and Fe deficiency has become a limiting environmental factor for plant growth. Here, we demonstrate that genus Malus adapt to Fe deficiency through modification of the Iron-Regulated Transporter1 (IRT1) promoter. Specifically, an IRT1 mutant allele with a TATA-box insertion in the promoter region upstream of the coding region exhibited increased IRT1 expression. The altered IRT1 promoter is responsible for enhancing Fe uptake. Increasing the number of synthetic repeat TATA-boxes correlates with increased promoter activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the insertion of the TATA-box correlates with an increase in transcriptional activation via specific binding of the transcription factor IID (MDP0000939369). Taken together, these results indicate that an allelic insertion of a TATA-box in a gene promoter has allowed apple to adapt to the selective pressure posed by Fe deficiency.

Transgenic hairy roots overexpressing GmAFS under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter were generated in an SCN-susceptible soybean line. The transgenic lines showed significantly higher resistance to SCN, which indicates that GmAFS contributes to the resistance of soybean to SCN. In soybean leaves, the expression of GmAFS was found to be induced by Tetranychus urticae (two-spotted spider mites). Exogenous application of methyl jasmonate to soybean plants also induced the expression of GmAFS in leaves. Using headspace collection combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, soybean plants that were infested with T. urticae were shown to emit a mixture of volatiles with (E,E)-α-farnesene as one of the most abundant constituents. In summary, this study showed that GmAFS has defence roles in both below-ground and above-ground organs of soybean against nematodes and insects, respectively.",Plant biotechnology journal,"['D000818', 'D018506', 'D007313', 'D009348', 'D010940', 'D030821', 'D011755', 'D013025']","['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Insecta', 'Nematoda', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Pyrophosphatases', 'Soybeans']","An (E,E)-α-farnesene synthase gene of soybean has a role in defence against nematodes and is involved in synthesizing insect-induced volatiles.","[None, None, 'Q000502', 'Q000472', 'Q000235', 'Q000201', 'Q000235', 'Q000201']","[None, None, 'physiology', 'pathogenicity', 'genetics', 'enzymology', 'genetics', 'enzymology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27734633,2017,0,0,genetic study ,apple,0.09574468085106383,"['methyl jasmonate', 'terpene', 'headspace', 'nematodes', 'E)-α-farnesene', 'sesquiterpene (E']",1,9

A phylogenetic analysis of MdMYB93 and Arabidopsis thaliana MYBs was performed and the function of MdMYB93 was further investigated using Agrobacterium-mediated transient overexpression in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. An RNA-Seq analysis was performed to highlight the MdMYB93-regulated genes.

27649517,"Garlic causes a strong garlic breath that may persist for almost a day. Therefore, it is important to study deodorization techniques for garlic breath. The volatiles responsible for garlic breath include diallyl disulfide, allyl mercaptan, allyl methyl disulfide, and allyl methyl sulfide. After eating garlic, water (control), raw, juiced or heated apple, raw or heated lettuce, raw or juiced mint leaves, or green tea were consumed immediately. The levels of the garlic volatiles on the breath were analyzed from 1 to 60 min by selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS). Garlic was also blended with water (control), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), rosemarinic acid, quercetin or catechin, and the volatiles in the headspace analyzed from 3 to 40 min by SIFT-MS. Raw apple, raw lettuce, and mint leaves significantly decreased all of the garlic breath volatiles in vivo. The proposed mechanism is enzymatic deodorization where volatiles react with phenolic compounds. Apple juice and mint juice also had a deodorizing effect on most of the garlic volatiles but were generally not as effective as the raw food, probably because the juice had enzymatic activity but the phenolic compounds had already polymerized. Both heated apple and heated lettuce produced a significant reduction of diallyl disulfide and allyl mercaptan. The presence of phenolic compounds that react with the volatile compounds even in the absence of enzymes is the most likely mechanism. Green tea had no deodorizing effect on the garlic volatile compounds. Rosmarinic acid, catechin, quercetin, and PPO significantly decreased all garlic breath volatiles in vitro.

The anti-microbial activities of biphenyls have been reported in a number of studies and they appear to represent an important defense strategy against pathogens common in the Maloideae, such as species in Malus, Pyrus, Sorbus, and Chaenomeles. Here, cell suspension cultures of Sorbus pohuashanensis were established to study biphenyl phytoalexins formation after yeast extract (YE) treatment. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) method coupled with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF-MS) LC-MS/MS was applied to determine the time course of these biphenyl biomarkers accumulation in YE-treated S. pohuashanensis suspension cells.

Starting by the analytic characterization of phenolic compounds in three apple varieties, i.e. Annurca, Red Delicious, and Golden Delicious, we used computational approaches to verify by reverse docking the potential protein targets of the identified compounds. Direct docking validation of the potential protein-ligand interactions has generated a short list of human proteins potentially bound by the apple phenolic compounds.

In order to meet with the increasingly growing field of metabolomics and heavy workload of data processing, we designed the first remote metabolomic data screening platform for mobile devices. Two mobile applications (apps), XCMS Mobile and METLIN Mobile, facilitate access to XCMS and METLIN, which are the most important components in the computer-based XCMS Online platforms. These mobile apps allow for the visualization and analysis of metabolic data throughout the entire analytical process. Specifically, XCMS Mobile and METLIN Mobile provide the capabilities for remote monitoring of data processing, real time notifications for the data processing, visualization and interactive analysis of processed data (e.g., cloud plots, principle component analysis, box-plots, extracted ion chromatograms, and hierarchical cluster analysis), and database searching for metabolite identification. These apps, available on Apple iOS and Google Android operating systems, allow for the migration of metabolomic research onto mobile devices for better accessibility beyond direct instrument operation.

The automatic device was aimed to reduce labor-consuming manual operation workload in the cleanup steps. It could control the volume and the speed of pulling and pushing cycles accurately. In this work, m-PFC was based on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) mixed with other sorbents and anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) in a packed tip for analysis of pesticide multi-residues in crop commodities followed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) detection. It was validated by analyzing 25 pesticides in six representative matrices spiked at two concentration levels of 10 and 100μg/kg. Salts, sorbents, m-PFC procedure, automated pulling and pushing volume, automated pulling speed, and pushing speed for each matrix were optimized. After optimization, two general automated m-PFC methods were introduced to relatively simple (apple, citrus fruit, peanut) and relatively complex (spinach, leek, green tea) matrices. Spike recoveries were within 83 and 108% and 1-14% RSD for most analytes in the tested matrices.

However, the role of highly polymeric procyanidins (PP), which are major non-absorbable flavonoids, in the biological effects, is not completely understood. Here, we show that 0.5% PP administration for 20 weeks alleviated obesity and regulate expression of genes related to lipid metabolism in C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat/high-sucrose diet. PP-treatment attenuated weight gain and inflammatory effects including lipopolysaccharide and gut permeability. Additionally, metabolic urine profiling using high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight/mass spectrometry demonstrated that PP-treatment decreased the levels of endogenous metabolites associated with insulin resistance. Furthermore, microbial 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the cecum demonstrated that PP administration markedly decreased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and increased eight times the proportion of Akkermansia.

27497009,"Chlorogenic acids are among the most abundant phenolics found in the human diet. Of these, the mono-caffeoylquinic acids are the predominant phenolics found in fruits, such as apples and pears, and products derived from them. In this research, a comprehensive study of the electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) dissociation behavior of the three most common mono-caffeoylquinic acids, namely 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (5-CQA), 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid (3-CQA) and 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid (4-CQA), were determined using both positive and negative ionization. All proposed structures of the observed product ions were confirmed with second-generation MS(3) experiments. Similarities and differences between the dissociation pathways in the positive and negative ion modes are discussed, confirming the proposed structures and the established MS/MS fingerprints. MS/MS dissociation was primarily driven via the cleavage of the ester bond linking the quinic acid moiety to the caffeic acid moiety within tested molecules. Despite being structural isomers with the same m/z values and dissociation behaviors, the MS/MS data in the negative ion mode was able to differentiate the three isomers based on ion intensity for the major product ions, observed at m/z 191, 179 and 173. This differentiation was consistent among various MS instruments. In addition, ESI coupled with high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (ESI-FAIMS-MS) was employed for the separation of these compounds for the first time. By combining MS/MS data and differential ion mobility, a method for the separation and identification of mono-caffeoylquinic in apple/pear juice samples was developed with a run time of less than 1 min. It is envisaged that this methodology could be used to identify pure juices based on their chlorogenic acid profile (i.e., metabolomics), and could also be used to detect juice-to-juice adulteration (e.g., apple juice addition to pear juice).

27443204,"Most countries have clearly defined regulations governing the use of pesticides in agricultural activity. The application of pesticides in agriculture usually leads to a residual amount of these pesticides on food products such as fruit and vegetables. The presence of pesticide residues on these foods destined for human consumption may pose food safety risks to consumers. To protect consumers, national authorities have established maximum limits for pesticide residues in foods. These limits can only be enforced if there are methods available to detect and monitor their concentrations in the applicable food products. To support the enforcement of this legislation, we have developed a multi-residue liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the analysis of 120 pesticide residues in apples and cucumbers which has been validated and implemented in the routine monitoring and surveillance programme for these pesticides. In this method, apple and cucumber samples are extracted using the QuEChERS method (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) and the extracts were analyzed directly by LC-MS/MS. The mean recoveries at three different concentrations of 0.01 µg/g , 0.05 µg/g, and 0.1 µg/g over the analytical range varied between 70 and 120%. The repeatability of the method expressed as %RSD was less than 20%.

The limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method was 0.01 µg/g for apples and cucumbers. The method has been used for the analysis of over 600 apple and 550 cucumber samples over the past two years.

The procedure involved extraction of the rodenticides from samples with acetone, followed by liquid-liquid partitioning with hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) and 10% sodium chloride aqueous solution, then cleanup using GPC, and finally, analysis using LC-MS/MS. High recoveries from the GPC column were obtained for all rodenticides tested using a mobile phase of acetone/cyclohexane/triethylamine (400:1600:1, v/v/v). An ODS column, which contains low levels of metal impurities, gave satisfactory peak shapes for both hydroxycoumarin- and indandione-type rodenticides in the LC-MS/MS separation. The average recoveries of rodenticides from eight agricultural foods (apple, eggplant, cabbage, orange, potato, tomato, brown rice, and soybean) fortified at 0.0005-0.001 mg/kg ranged from 76 to 116%, except for bromadiolone in orange (53%) and diphacinone in soybean (54%), and the relative standard deviations ranged from 1 to 16%. The proposed method effectively removed interfering components, such as pigments and lipids, and showed high selectivity. In addition, the matrix effects were negligible for most of the rodenticide/food combinations.

27338331,"""Starkrimson"" is a traditional apple cultivar that was developed a long time ago and was widely cultivated in the arid region of the northern Wei River of China. However, little information regarding the quality characteristics of ""Starkrimson"" fruit has been reported in this area.

The results indicated that the changes in anthocyanin contents took place later than the changes in the Commission International Eclairage (CIE) parameters. Meanwhile, cyanidin 3-galactoside (cy3-gal), fructose, sucrose, glucose and malic acid were the primary organic compounds, and 1-butanol-2-methyl-acetate, 2-hexenal and 1-hexanol were the most abundant aroma components in the skin. Furthermore, rapidly changing soluble sugars and organic acid synchronization took place in the early ripening period, while rapidly changing aroma components occurred later, on the basis of fresh weight.

For the extraction and cleanup, original QuEChERS method was followed, then the samples were subjected to liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for chromatographic analyses. According to t test, matrix effect was not significant for chlorpyrifos in both sample matrices, but it was significant for dimethoate, indoxacarb and imidacloprid in both sample matrices. Thus, matrix-matched calibration (MC) was used to compensate matrix effect and quantifications were carried out by using MC. The overall recovery of the method was 90.15% with a relative standard deviation of 13.27% (n = 330). Estimated method detection limit of analytes blew the MRLs.

27299743,"NO donors and Arg remove dormancy of apple embryos and stimulate germination. Compounds lowering NO level (cPTIO, L -NAME, CAN) strengthen dormancy. Embryo transition from dormancy state to germination is linked to increased nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-like activity. Germination of embryos is associated with declined level of biotin containing proteins and nitrated proteins in soluble protein fraction of root axis. Pattern of nitrated proteins suggest that storage proteins are putative targets of nitration. Nitric oxide (NO) acts as a key regulatory factor in removal of seed dormancy and is a signal necessary for seed transition from dormant state into germination. Modulation of NO concentration in apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) embryos by NO fumigation, treatment with NO donor (S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine, SNAP), application of 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO), N ω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), canavanine (CAN) or arginine (Arg) allowed us to investigate the NO impact on seed dormancy status. Arg analogs and NO scavenger strengthened embryo dormancy by lowering reactive nitrogen species level in embryonic axes. This effect was accompanied by strong inhibition of NOS-like activity, without significant influence on tissue NO2 (-) concentration. Germination sensu stricto of apple embryos initiated by dormancy breakage via short term NO treatment or Arg supplementation were linked to a reduced level of biotinylated proteins in root axis. Decrease of total soluble nitrated proteins was observed at the termination of germination sensu stricto. Also modulation of NO tissue status leads to modification in nitrated protein pattern. Among protein bands that correspond to molecular mass of approximately 95 kDa, storage proteins (legumin A-like and seed biotin-containing protein) were identified, and can be considered as good markers for seed dormancy status.

27216966,"Persistent organic pollutants have been lately taken into consideration for their adverse effects, as possible stillbirth contributors; stillbirth can be in fact considered the most dramatic pregnancy complication. Congenital abnormalities account for few stillbirths and many related disorders are potentially modifiable or often coexist, such as maternal infections, non-communicable diseases, lifestyle factors and maternal age. Causal pathways for stillbirth frequently involve impaired placental function, either with fetal growth restriction or preterm labour. For this reason, many current efforts are focusing on the study of endocrine disruptor (ED) placental transfer, to better understand the in utero exposure dynamics. In this regard, our research group has investigated, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, the EDs presence in brain samples of 24 stillbirths, collected over a 3-year period (2012-2014), coming from the Northeast Italy, a notorious area devoted to apple cultivation. Surprisingly, organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), well-known EDs, have been detected in 11 samples. Apart from the noteworthy evidence of pesticides' bio-persistence, this finding implies a redefinition of the placental barrier concept: not a real safety system, but a time-deferral mechanism of absorption. The term 'placental barrier' in fact refers to a 4-membrane structure, made up by two epithelial layers, which exactly lining the chorionic villi, and by two endothelial layers, belonging to the feeding vessels for the fetus. It is an effective barrier only for a low administration of water-soluble substances, which encounter obstacle to cross four instead of two membranes. High doses of water-soluble compounds can reach appreciable concentration in the fetal blood, and the lipid-soluble chemicals, such as EDs, are able to pass the placental barrier, through a simple mechanism of passive diffusion, even in minimal concentrations. After crossing the placental barrier, it is emerged from our results that they can also pass through the still immature blood-brain barrier of the fetus.

Moreover, the results from biological tests on colony growth inhibition and spore germination indicated that SE-I, SE-II, and SE-III could inhibit hyphal growth and spore generation of three important plant pathogenic fungi (Monilinia fructicola, Fusarium oxysporum, and Botryosphaeria dothidea). The study of the mechanisms of resistant fungi revealed that the oxidation resistance system, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), was activated. The expression of genes related to defense, such as pathogenesis-related protein (PR4), α-farnesene synthase (AFS), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) were shown to be up-regulated after treatment with SEs, which suggested an increase in apple immunity and that fruits were induced to effectively defend against the infection of pathogenic fungi (B. dothidea). This study revealed that SEs and their lignans represent promising resources for the development of safe, effective, and multi-targeted agents against pathogenic fungi.",PloS one,"['D000935', 'D002851', 'D002853', 'D032141', 'D021241', 'D013056']","['Antifungal Agents', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Schisandra', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",Extraction and Separation of Active Ingredients in Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.)

27130088,"A method was established to simultaneously determine cadmium, iron and tin in canned-food samples using high-resolution continuum source graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (HR-CS GF AAS). The quantification step has been performed using the primary line (228.802nm) for cadmium and the adjacent secondary lines (228.725nm and 228.668nm) for iron and tin, respectively. The selected chemical modifier was an acid solution that contained a mixture of 0.1% (w/v) Pd and 0.05% (w/v) Mg. The absorbance signals were measured based on the peak area using 3 pixels for cadmium and 5 pixels for iron and tin. Under these conditions, cadmium, iron and tin have been determined in canned-food samples using the external calibration technique based on aqueous standards, where the limits of quantification were 2.10ngg(-1) for cadmium, 1.95mgkg(-1) for iron and 3.00mgkg(-1) for tin, and the characteristic masses were 1.0pg for cadmium, 0.9ng for iron and 1.1ng for tin. The precision was evaluated using two solutions of each metal ion, and the results, which were expressed as the relative standard deviation (RSD%), were 3.4-6.8%. The method accuracy for cadmium and iron was confirmed by analyzing a certified reference material of apple leaves (NIST 1515), which was supplied by NIST.

Pesticide residues were quantified with solvent-matched and matrix-matched standards, by spiking apple sample extracts. Matrix effects dependent on the type of extract (fruit, flesh, or peel) and the apple variety were detected. The best data processing methods involved normalizing matrix effect rates by matrix-matched internal/external calibration. Boscalid, captan, chlorpyrifos, fludioxonil, and pyraclostrobin were the most frequently detected pesticides. However, their concentrations in the whole fruit were below European maximum residue levels.

27085062,"Bee products, such as honey, are widely consumed as food and consumer interest is currently oriented towards organic foods. Regarding this, the European Commission establishes that the qualification of organic honey and other beekeeping products as being from organic production is closely bound with the characteristics of hive treatments as well as the quality of the environment. Agricultural contamination with pesticides is a challenging problem that needs to be fully addressed, in particular in the field of organic production systems. In this study, the occurrence of different classes of contaminants selected as representative of potential contamination sources were investigated in 59 organic honeys: organochlorines, OCs; organophosphates, OPs; polychlorobiphenyls, PCBs and polybromodiphenylethers, PBDEs. A method based on Accelerated Solvent Extraction with ""in line"" clean-up and GC-MS/MS detection was developed to detect contaminants. Residues of many pesticides were found in most of the samples investigated. The majority of honey samples contained at least one of the pesticides, even if their concentrations were found to be lower than its MRL. Diazinon, Mevinphos, Coumaphos, Chlorpyrifos and Quinoxyfen were the residues frequently detected in samples coming from the apple and citrus orchard areas. Furthermore, the results of the present study show that the presence of the residue in organic honey may also be affected by the geographical area (e.g. the presence of an agricultural system) confirming honey bee and beehive matrices as appropriate sentinels for monitoring contamination in the environment.

26939054,"Japanese ginjo sake is a premium refined sake characterized by a pleasant fruity apple-like flavor and a sophisticated taste. Because of technical difficulties inherent in brewing ginjo sake, off-flavors sometimes occur. However, the metabolites responsible for off-flavors as well as those present or absent in higher quality ginjo sake remain uncertain. Here, the relationship between 202 polar chemical compounds in sake identified using capillary electrophoresis coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry and its organoleptic properties, such as quality and off-flavor, was examined. First, we found that some off-flavored sakes contained higher total amounts of metabolites than other sake samples. The results also identified that levels of 2-oxoglutaric acid and fumaric acid, metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, were highly but oppositely correlated with ginjo sake quality. Similarly, pyridoxine and pyridoxamine, co-enzymes for amino transferase, were also highly but oppositely correlated with ginjo sake quality. Additionally, pyruvic acid levels were associated with good quality as well. Compounds involved in the methionine salvage cycle, oxidative glutathione derivatives, and amino acid catabolites were correlated with low quality. Among off-flavors, an inharmonious bitter taste appeared attributable to polyamines. Furthermore, protein analysis displayed that a diversity of protein components and yeast protein (triosephosphate isomerase, TPI) leakage was linked to the overall metabolite intensity in ginjo sake. This research provides insight into the relationship between sake components and organoleptic properties.

Here, an infection model is introduced to study proteomic changes in a highly virulent E. amylovora strain upon interaction with its host as compared to a lower virulent strain. For this purpose separate shoots of apple rootstocks were wound-infected and when infection became systemic, bacterial cells were isolated and processed for analysis in a proteomics platform combining 2-D fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Comparing the proteome of the isolates, significant abundance changes were observed in proteins involved in sorbitol metabolism, amylovoran production as well as in protection against plant defense mechanisms. Furthermore several proteins associated with virulence were more abundant in the higher virulent strain. Changes at the proteome level showed good accordance at the transcript level, as was verified by RT-qPCR.

Under the optimized CCC operation conditions, trace amounts of AOH, AME, and TeA in large volume of liquid sample were efficiently extracted and enriched in the stationary phase, and then eluted out just by reversing the stationary phase as mobile phase in the opposite flowing direction tail-to-head. The enrichment and elution strategies are unique and can be fulfilled online with high enrichment factors (87-114) and high recoveries (81.14-110.94%). The method has been successively applied to the determination of Alternaria mycotoxins in real apple juice and wine samples with the limits of detection (LOD) in the range of 0.03-0.14μgL(-1). Totally 12 wine samples and 15 apple juice samples from the local market were analyzed. The detection rate of AOH and AME in both kinds of the samples were more than 50%, while TeA was found in relatively high level of 1.75-49.61μgL(-1) in some of the apple juice samples. The proposed method is simple, rapid, and sensitive and could also be used for the analysis and monitoring of Alternaria mycotoxin in other food samples. ",Journal of chromatography.

26830581,"In this paper, the novel hydrophilic magnetic molecularly imprinted nanoparticles were developed for selective separation and determination of chlorogenic acid in aqueous fruit juices. The polymers were prepared by using amino-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles as carriers, branched polyethyleneimine as functional monomer, and chlorogenic acid as template molecule. Branched polyethyleneimine with abundant active amino groups could react with template sufficiently, and its unique dendritic structure may amplify the number of the imprinted cavities. Meanwhile, it would improve the hydrophilicity of imprinted materials for attaining high extraction efficiency. The resulted polymers exhibit fast kinetics, high adsorption capacity, and favorable selectivity. In addition, the obtained nanoparticles were used as solid-phase extraction sorbents for selective isolation and determination of chlorogenic acid in peach, apple, and grape juices (0.92, 4.21, and 0.75 μg mL(-1), respectively).",Food chemistry,"['D002726', 'D002851', 'D000067030', 'D008280', 'D054802', 'D053758', 'D052616']","['Chlorogenic Acid', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fruit and Vegetable Juices', 'Magnetics', 'Molecular Imprinting', 'Nanoparticles', 'Solid Phase Extraction']",Selective extraction and determination of chlorogenic acid in fruit juices using hydrophilic magnetic imprinted nanoparticles.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000379']","['chemistry', None, 'analysis', 'methods', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26830581,2016,0,1,chlorogenic acid in apple juice,apple,0.20454545454545456,"['chlorogenic acid', 'aqueous fruit', 'polyethyleneimine', 'nanoparticles']",1,9
26797601,"The transference and reactivity of proanthocyanidins is an important issue that affects the technological processing of some fruits, such as grapes and apples. These processes are affected by proanthocyanidins bound to cell wall polysaccharides, which are present in high concentrations during the processing of the fruits. Therefore, the effective extraction of proanthocyanidins from fruits to their juices or derived products will depend on the ability to manage these associations, and, in this respect, enzymes that degrade these polysaccharides could play an important role. The main objective of this work was to test the role of pure hydrolytic enzymes (polygalacturonase and cellulose) and a commercial enzyme containing these two activities on the extent of proanthocyanidin-cell wall interactions. The results showed that the modification promoted by enzymes reduced the amount of proanthocyanidins adsorbed to cell walls since they contributed to the degradation and release of the cell wall polysaccharides, which diffused into the model solution. Some of these released polysaccharides also presented some reactivity towards the proanthocyanidins present in a model solution.

26776005,"A novel syringe needle-based sampling approach coupled with liquid-phase extraction (NBS-LPE) was developed and applied to the extraction of l-ascorbic acid (AsA) in apple. In NBS-LPE, only a small amount of apple flesh (ca. 10mg) was sampled directly using a syringe needle and placed in a glass insert for liquid extraction of AsA by 80 μL oxalic acid-acetic acid. The extract was then directly analyzed by liquid chromatography. This new procedure is simple, convenient, almost organic solvent free, and causes far less damage to the fruit. To demonstrate the applicability of NBS-LPE, AsA levels at different sampling points in a single apple were determined to reveal the spatial distribution of the analyte in a three-dimensional model. The results also showed that this method had good sensitivity (limit of detection of 0.0097 mg/100g; limit of quantification of 0.0323 mg/100g), acceptable reproducibility (relative standard deviation of 5.01% (n=6)), a wide linear range of between 0.05 and 50mg/100g, and good linearity (r(2)=0.9921).

26756813,"To learn how the endogenous polyphenols may play a role in fruit ripening and senescence, apple pulp discs were used as a model to study the influences of chlorogenic acid (CHA, a major polyphenol in apple pulp) on fruit ripening and senescence. Apple ('Golden Delicious') pulp discs prepared from pre-climacteric fruit were treated with 50 mg L(-1) CHA and incubated in flasks with 10 mM MES buffer (pH 6.0, 11% sorbitol). Compared to the control samples, treatment with CHA significantly reduced ethylene production and respiration rate, and enhanced levels of firmness and soluble solids content of the pulp discs during incubation at 25°C. These results suggested that CHA could retard senescence of the apple pulp discs. Proteomics analysis with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF) revealed that the expressions of several key proteins correlated to fruit ripening and senescence were affected by the treatment with CHA. Further study showed that treating the pulp discs with CHA remarkably reduced levels of lipoxygenase, β-galactosidase, NADP-malic enzyme, and enzymatic activities of lipoxygenase and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, all of which are known as promoters of fruit ripening and senescence.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether occupational allergy to peach tree pollen as a member of Rosaceae family is IgE-mediated and to evaluate the cross-reactivity among Rosaceae family pollens. Allergen skin test and conjunctival challenge test were performed; enzyme linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA), inhibiting ELISA, western immunoblotting and inhibiting western immunoblotting were done with Rosaceae family orchard pollens, including peach, apricot, cherry, apple and pear tree pollens. Mass spectrometry was also performed to probe the main allergen component and cross-reactive protein. Sensitizations to peach pollen were found in both skin test and conjunctival challenge in the patients. Serum specific IgE to three pollens (peach, apricot and cherry) were detected through ELISA. When peach pollen used as solid phase, ELISA inhibition revealed other four kinds of pollens capable of inducing partial to strong inhibitions (45% to 87%), with the strongest inhibition belonging to apricot pollen (87%). Western blotting showed predominant IgE binding to a 20 KD protein among these pollens, which appeared to be a cross-reactive allergen component through western blotting inhibition.

26726936,"A simple and rapid extraction procedure for the simultaneous determination of eight mycotoxins (Alternaria toxins, ochratoxin A, patulin, citrinin) in a variety of fruit matrices has been developed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The procedure involves a one-step cleanup using homemade solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges. By comparative evaluation among six various adsorbents (C18, PSA, HLB, MCX, Silica, NH2), the combination of MCX and NH2 was found to provide the most effective cleanup, removing the greatest number of matrix interferences and also allowing the quantification of all analyzed mycotoxins in fruits. The optimized extraction conditions including acidified aqueous acetonitrile and an additional salt-out step using NaCl were employed before SPE cleanup. Method validation was performed by analyzing samples spiked at three levels (LOQ, 2 LOQ and 10 LOQ). Four fruits including apple, sweet cherry, tomato and orange fruits were selected, and accuracy (recovery%), precision (RSD%), limits of quantification (LOQ), linearity and matrix effect were evaluated during validation. Matrix-matched linearity with correlation coefficients ≥ 0.9921 was established in the range of 5-200 ng mL(-1) for patulin and 1-200 ng mL(-1) for other mycotoxins, respectively. Recoveries between 74.2% and 102.4% and relative standard deviations lower than 4.7% were obtained for all tested fruits.

Methanol was not detectable in apple wine made from genuine musts during fermentation but after a storage period. In some cases, concentrations of some CAs additionally changed during storage.

Butroxydim was extracted with acetonitrile and an aliquot of the crude extract was cleaned up on an octadecyl silanized silica gel (C18) cartridge column (1,000 mg), followed by a salting-out step to remove water. Before purification on a silica gel (SI) cartridge column (690 mg), polar matrices were precipitated by adding ethyl acetate, n-hexane and anhydrous sodium sulfate successively. This process effectively removed caffeine and catechins and improved recovery when analyzing residual butroxydim in tea leaves. Recovery and repeatability were good; the relative standard deviations were less than 5% for all 12 tested agricultural products (brown rice, soybean, potato, spinach, cabbage, apple, orange, grapefruit, lemon, tomato, peas with pods, and tea).

26682617,"Pomace is an easy-accessible raw material for the isolation of fruit-derived compounds. Fruit consumption is associated with health-promoting effects, such as the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Increased vascular nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, for example, due to an enhanced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, could be one molecular mechanism mediating this effect. To identify compounds from apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) pomace that have the potential to amplify NO bioavailability via eNOS activation, a bioassay-guided fractionation of the methanol/water (70:30) extract has been performed using the (14)C-L-arginine to (14)C-L-citrulline conversion assay (ACCA) in the human endothelium-derived cell line EA.hy926.

In the present research, a rapid and nondestructive method was proposed and testified based on self-developed Raman system for the identification and determination of deltamethrin and acetamiprid remaining in apple. The peaks of Raman spectra at 574 and 843 cm(-1) can be used to identify deltamethrin and acetamiprid, respectively, the characteristic peaks of deltamethrin and acetamiprid were still visible when the concentrations of the two pesticides were 0.78 and 0.15 mg · kg(-1) in apples samples, respectively. Calibration models of pesticide content were developed by partial least square (PLS) algorithm with different spectra pretreatment methods (Savitzky-Golay smoothing, first derivative transformation, second derivative transformation, baseline calibration, standard normal variable transformation). The baseline calibration methods by 8th order polynomial fitting gave the best results. For deltamethrin, the obtained prediction coefficient (Rp) value from PLS model for the results of prediction and gas chromatography measurement was 0.94; and the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was 0.55 mg · kg(-1). The values of Rp and RMSEP were respective 0.85 and 0.12 mg · kg(-1) for acetamiprid. According to the detect performance, applying Raman technology in the nondestructive determination of pesticide residuals in apples is feasible. In consideration of that it needs no pretreatment before spectra collection and causes no damage to sample, this technology can be used in detection department, fruit and vegetable processing enterprises, supermarket, and vegetable market. The result of this research is promising for development of industrially feasible technology for rapid, nondestructive and real time detection of different types of pesticide with its concentration in apples.

26666307,"For the first time, an in vivo sampling mode of direct immersion-solid phase microextraction (DI-SPME) was employed to capture the metabolome of living plant specimens, using apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) as a model system. Metabolites were extracted from apple tissues and introduced by thermal desorption into a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry instrument. The feasibility of this sampling approach, based on exploitation of microextraction principles, including negligible depletion of free analyte concentrations, solventless sampling and sample preparation, and on-site compatibility, was determined in global metabolite analysis. Rather than adopting an approach of traditional sample preparation, requiring metabolism quenching and laborious sample preparation, the objective of the study was to capture the metabolome in vivo, evaluate the feasibility of the approach to provide unbiased extraction coverage, and compare analytical precision when different SPME sampling modes are employed. The potential of in vivo DI-SPME in quantitative plant metabolomics was assessed by evaluating changes in metabolic fingerprints in response to fruit maturation. The in vivo SPME sampling approach has been demonstrated as capable of sampling living systems with high reproducibility, considering that nearly 50% of hundreds of evaluated compounds included in the determination of analytical performance met the 15% RSD FDA criterion. Esters were extracted with high repeatability (% RSD for hexyl butanoate and butyl butanoate of 16.5 and 5.9, respectively, from 9 determinations in 3 apples) and found to be upregulated in response to apple fruit maturation.

26592573,"This paper focuses on the application of a two-level full factorial design to optimize the key derivatization step before the GC-FID and GC-MS analysis of pentacyclic triterpenes. The derivatization reaction was screened for influential factors and statistically significant parameters with a p value less than 0.05. A multi-response optimization based on a desirability function was then applied, while simultaneously considering overall detection enhancement of compounds. Results showed that derivatization using N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) in pyridine (22:13:65v/v/v) for 2h at 30°C was the most efficient method of derivatizing all the hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups contained in the triterpene structures. The validity of the method was demonstrated using GC-MS analyzes of a mixture containing eleven standards (β-amyrin, α-amyrin, lupeol, erythrodiol, uvaol, betulin, oleanolic acid, betulinic acid, ursolic acid, maslinic acid and corosolic acid). These compounds are representative of different classes of terpene compounds bearing different functional groups such as alcohols, diols, and carboxylic acids. The derivatization procedure was then tested on four plant extracts: apple pomace, salvia sclarea (dried leaves and flowers), sea buckthorn (Hyppophae rhammnoides L.) berries, and B. serrata resin. The identification of triterpenes was based on the comparison of their retention time and mass spectra to those of standards.

Furthermore, the migration of AgNPs from silver-impregnated polypropylene food storage boxes to fresh pepper was observed and a mussel sample obtained from a laboratory exposure study with silver was investigated. The differences in the atomization delays (Δt(ad)) between silver ions and 20-nm AgNPs vary in a range from -2.01 ± 1.38 s for maize meal to +2.06 ± 1.08 s for mussel tissue. However, the differences were significant in all investigated matrices and so indicative of the presence/absence of AgNPs. Moreover, investigation of model matrices (cellulose, gelatine and water) gives the first indication of matrix-dependent trends.

26479897,"The applicability of liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) for the quantitative analysis of pesticide residues in vegetables and fruits was demonstrated. The LC-QTOF-MS parameters, such as cone voltage, capillary voltage, collision energy and mass extraction window, were carefully optimised for the analysis of pesticide residues. The LC-QTOF-MS method was validated for 149 pesticides in four vegetables and fruits, i.e. apple, potato, cabbage and spinach, at a spiking level of 0.01 mg kg(-1). The samples were prepared according to the Japanese official multi-residue method with a modification to the column clean-up procedure. Of the 149 pesticides, recoveries in the range of 70-120% were achieved for 147 pesticides in apple, 145 in potato, 141 in cabbage and 131 in spinach, with intra-day precisions (RSDs) of < 25% and inter-day precisions (RSDs) of < 30%, which are within the acceptable range given in the Japanese method validation guideline. Matrix effects were negligible for the majority of the target pesticides. Except for spiroxamine in spinach, no interfering peaks were observed in the blank samples. The target pesticides, except those with low sensitivity, achieved calibration curves with satisfactory linearity, with correlation coefficients (r) greater than 0.995 in the concentration range of 0.002-0.1 μg ml(-1). Furthermore, the majority of the target pesticides provided more than one fragment ion or isotope ion that could be used for confirmation. The overall results suggest that LC-QTOF-MS is a powerful tool for the quantification of pesticide residues in vegetables and fruits at the level of 0.01 mg kg(-1). ","Food additives & contaminants.

An Eichrom Sr resin was used for matrix separation and an improved Zr empirical external normalization coupled with standard-sample bracketing method (Zr EEN-SSB) was applied to mass bias correction during Sr isotope MC-ICP-MS measurements. Potential influences of matrix elements, and polyatomic and isobaric interferences on the Sr isotopic determination were further evaluated using NIST SRM 987 Sr isotopic standard spiked with various amount of Ca, Mg, and Rb contents. Concentrations of Ca and Mg lower than 30 ng g(-1) or Rb < 2 ng g(-1) in 150 ng g(-1) Sr analyte were estimated to have only a minor effect on Sr isotope ratios determination. On the other hand, intensity differences between sample and standards (IntSample/IntStandards) represented a large δ (88/86)Sr deviation of <0.9 or >1.3, reflecting the significance of intensity bias attributed to different mass bias behavior. An apple leaf material, NIST SRM 1515, was adopted as the plant material for overall evaluation of sample digestion, matrix separation, and potential spectral interferences on the measurements of Sr isotope ratios. Our results suggest that the partially remaining organic compounds in the incomplete digestion would have a significant bias on the extraction chromatography procedure, resulting in sizable uncertainty in δ (88/86)Sr ratios. Thus, complete digestion of the organic-enriched materials is of great importance for efficiency assurance in matrix separation. Extraction chromatography works well for the total digested samples, where Ca, Mg, and Rb were efficiently removed. The obtained average (87)Sr/(86)Sr and δ (88/86)Sr values for the NIST SRM 1515 apple leaves are 0.71398 ± 0.00004 and 0.23 ± 0.03‰ (2SD, n = 10), respectively.

The sorbent was synthesized by combining of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and Aliquat(®)336 thiosalicylate, [A336][TS], a thiol-containing task specific ionic liquid (TSIL). The high affinity of TSIL toward the target compound as well as the magnetic behavior of Fe3O4 was combined to provide an efficient and simple magnetic sorbent for solid-phase extraction (SPE). The prepared nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The important parameters influencing the extraction efficiency such as pH, sorbent dosage, extraction and desorption conditions were studied and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, the calibration curve was linear in the range of 2.5-260 ng mL(-1) and good linearity (R(2)>0.996) was obtained. The limit of detection (LOD) and enrichment factor (EF) of the method were found to be 0.5 ng mL(-1) and 50, respectively.

The logistic model was used to study the kinetics of spore germination. Prediction and validation of antifungal effect of BLEO was performed on semi-synthetic medium (apple juice agar) using predictive microbiological tools. The Baranyi and Roberts model was used to estimate maximum growth rate (μmax in mm/day) and apparent lag time (λ in days) of the mould. Secondary modelling was performed using a re-parameterized Monod-type equation based on cardinal values to study the effect of different BLEO concentration on estimated growth parameters. Emax (minimum concentration of oil at which mould growth was inhibited) and MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration of BLEO at which lag time is infinite) value of BLEO against P. expansum was estimated to be 0.56 and 0.74 μl/ml, respectively, which was found to be similar on potato dextrose agar (PDA) as well as apple juice agar (AJA) medium. The correlation between estimated growth parameters of the mould on both the media was obtained with satisfactory statistical indices (R(2) and RMSE).

The MIP-coated fiber possessed excellent thermal and chemical stability as well as high extraction capacity. Its selectivity and possible recognition mechanism were investigated. The similarities in molecular shape and functional group play a key role in the selective recognition of the imprinted material.

The experiment demonstrates that the proposed method using the calixarene MIP fiber was more suitable for selective determination of trace OPPs in those fruit samples. ,Food chemistry,"['D031230', 'D047250', 'D002849', 'D004043', 'D005506', 'D005638', 'D059625', 'D027845', 'D054802', 'D010575', 'D011108', 'D052617']","['Ananas', 'Calixarenes', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Food Contamination', 'Fruit', 'Liquid-Liquid Extraction', 'Malus', 'Molecular Imprinting', 'Pesticides', 'Polymers', 'Solid Phase Microextraction']",Molecularly imprinted calixarene fiber for solid-phase microextraction of four organophosphorous pesticides in fruits.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000379']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26304345,2016,0,0,spiked apple,apple,0.08163265306122448,"['organophosphorus pesticides', 'MIP', 'SPME']",1,4
26298695,"During the seasonal shift from June to August, air temperatures increase. To explore how apple trees improve their thermotolerance during this shift, we examined the photochemical reaction capacity of apple tree leaves by simultaneous measurement of prompt chlorophyll fluorescence, delayed chlorophyll fluorescence, and modulated 820 nm reflection at varying temperatures. It was found that the reaction centers and antennae of photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI), the donor side of PSII, the electron transfer capacity from QA to QB, and the reoxidation capacity of plastoquinol were all sensitive to heat stress, particularly in June. As the season shifted, apple tree leaves improved in thermotolerance. Interestingly, the acclimation to seasonal shift enhanced the thermotolerance of PSII and PSI reaction centers more than that of their antennae, and the activity of PSII more than that of PSI. This may be a strategy for plant adaptation to changes in environmental temperatures. In addition, results from prompt and delayed fluorescence, as well as modulated 820 nm reflection corroborate each other. We suggest that the simultaneous measurement of the three independent signals may provide more information on thermal acclimation mechanisms of photochemical reactions in plant leaves.","Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

The adsorbent (Fe3O4@SiO2@GO-PEA) was then used in a magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) of six organophosphorous pesticides (OPPs) including methyl parathion, fenitrothion, methidathion, ethion, methyl azinphos and coumaphos prior to gas chromatography-nitrogen phosphorus detection (GC-NPD). The fabricated adsorbent combines the advantages of superior adsorption capability of modified GO and magnetic separability of magnetite microparticles to provide high adsorption capacity, and easy isolation from sample solutions. The main experimental parameters affecting the extraction recovery of OPPs including extraction time, pH, adsorbent dosage, salt concentration, and desorption conditions were investigated and optimized. Under the optimal conditions, linear responses were obtained in the concentration range of 0.06-200μgL(-1) with the determination coefficients (R(2)) between 0.9945 and 0.9996.

26087169,"In this paper, we present a smartphone-readable barcode assay for the qualitative detection of methyl parathion residues, a toxic organophosphorus pesticide that is popularly used in agriculture worldwide. The detection principle is based on the irreversible inhibition of the enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) by methyl parathion; AchE catalytically hydrolyzes acetylthiocholine iodine to thiocholine that in turn dissociates dithiobis-nitrobenzoate to produce a yellow product (deprotonated thio-nitrobenzoate). The yellow intensity of the product was confirmed to be inversely dependent on the concentration of the pesticide. We have designed a barcode-formatted assay chip by using a PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) channel plate (as the reaction reservoir), situated under a printed partial barcode, to complete the whole barcode such that it can be directly read by a barcode scanning app installed on a smartphone. The app is able to qualitatively present the result of the pesticide test; the absence or a low concentration of methyl parathion results in the barcode reading as ""-"", identifying the test as negative for pesticides. Upon obtaining a positive result (the app reads a ""+"" character), the captured image can be further analyzed to quantitate the methyl parathion concentration in the sample. Besides the portability and simplicity, this mobile-app based colorimetric barcode assay compares favorably with the standard spectrophotometric method.

26086845,"Understanding the defence mechanisms used by apple leaves against Alternaria alternate pathogen infection is important for breeding purposes. To investigate the ultrastructural differences between leaf tissues of susceptible and resistant seedlings, in vitro inoculation assays and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis were conducted with two different inoculation assays. The results indicated that the resistant leaves may have certain antifungal activity against A. alternate that is lacking in susceptible leaves. To elucidate the two different host responses to A. alternate infection in apples, the proteomes of susceptible and resistant apple leaves that had or had not been infected with pathogen were characterised using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS). MS identified 43 differentially expressed proteins in two different inoculation assays. The known proteins were categorised into 5 classes, among these proteins, some pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, such as beta-1,3-glucanase, ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and mal d1, were identified in susceptible and resistant hosts and were associated with disease resistance of the apple host. In addition, the different levels of mal d1 in susceptible and resistant hosts may contribute to the outstanding anti-disease properties of resistant leaves against A. alternate. Taken together, the resistance mechanisms of the apple host against A. alternate may be a result of the PR proteins and other defence-related proteins. Given the complexity of the biology involved in the interaction between apple leaves and the A. alternate pathogen, further investigation will yield more valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of suppression of the A. alternate pathogen. Overall, we outline several novel insights into the response of apple leaves to pathogen attacks. These findings increase our knowledge of pathogen resistance mechanisms, and the data will also promote further investigation into the regulation of the expression of these target proteins.

26044382,"Some steps of the QuEChERS method for the analysis of pesticides with GC-MS/MS in cereals and dried fruits were improved or simplified. For the latter, a mixing vessel with stator-rotor-system proved to be advantageous. The extraction procedure of dried fruits is much easier and safer than the Ultra Turrax and results in excellent validation data at a concentration level of 0.01mg/kg (116 of 118 analytes with recoveries in the range of 70-120%, 117 of 118 analytes with RSD <20%). After qualifying problematic lipophilic pesticides in fat-rich cereals (fat content >7%), predominantly organochlorines showed recoveries of <70% in quantification when the standard QuEChERS method with water was used. A second extraction was carried out analogous to the QuEChERS method, however, without the addition of water. With this simple modification, the problematic lipophilic pesticides, which had been strongly affected by the fat content of the commodities, could be determined with recoveries above 70% even at a concentration level of 0.01mg/kg. Moreover, a GC-MS/MS screening method for 120 pesticides at a concentration level of 0.01mg/kg was established by employing analyte protectants (ethylglycerol, gulonolactone, and sorbitol). The use of only one standardized calibration, made of an apple purée extract in combination with analyte protectants, allowed for a qualitative and quantitative analysis of 120 pesticides in different matrix extracts (tomato, red pepper, sour cherries, dried apples, black currant powder, raisins, wheat flour, rolled oats, wheat germ). The analyte protectants leveled the differences in the matrix-induced protection effect of the analyzed extracts over a wide range.

26023940,"This study aimed to determine the volatile profile of cashew apple fibers to verify which compounds are still present after successive washings and thus might be responsible for the undesirable remaining cashew-like aroma present in this co-product, which is used to formulate food products like vegetarian burgers and cereal bars. Fibers were obtained from cashew apple juice processing and washed five times in an expeller press. Compounds were analyzed by the headspace solid-phase micro extraction technique (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), using a DB-5 column. Sensory analysis was also performed to compare the intensity of the cashew-like aroma of the fibers with the original juice. Altogether, 80 compounds were detected, being esters and terpenes the major chemical classes. Among the identified substances, 14 were classified as odoriferous in the literature, constituting the matrix used in the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Odoriferous esters were substantially reduced, but many compounds were extracted by the strength used in the expeller press and remained until the last wash. Among them are the odoriferous compounds ethyl octanoate, γ-dodecalactone, (E)-2-decenal, copaene, and caryophyllene that may contribute for the mild but still perceptible cashew apple aroma in the fibers that have been pressed and washed five times. Development of a deodorization process should include reduction of pressing force and stop at the second wash, to save water and energy, thus reducing operational costs and contributing to process sustainability.

In the present study, we analyzed the differences in the emission of VOCs from single fruits at harvest and after a storage period of 60±10 days, followed by 3 d of shelf life. Our results show that VOC profile differences among apple cultivars were more pronounced after storage than at harvest. Furthermore, chemodiversity was higher in old cultivars compared to modern cultivars, probably due to their greater genetic variability.

The polymerase chain reaction and the real time PCR have been widely used for this purpose. Apples are suitable substrates for fungal colonization mostly caused by Penicillium expansum, which produces the mycotoxin patulin during fruit infection. This study describes the development of a real-time PCR assay incorporating an internal amplification control (IAC) to specifically detect and quantify P. expansum. A specific primer pair was designed from the patF gene, involved in patulin biosynthesis. The selected primer set showed a high specificity for P. expansum and was successfully employed in a standardized real-time PCR for the direct quantification of this fungus in apples. Using the developed system, twenty eight apples were analyzed for their DNA content. Apples were also analyzed for patulin content by HPLC. Interestingly, a positive correlation (R(2) = 0.701) was found between P. expansum DNA content and patulin concentration.

In this work, we present a novel fluorescence polarization approach based on the use of emergent near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence probes. The use of these fluorophores coupled to anti-PAT antibodies makes possible the detection of PAT directly in apple juice without any sample pretreatment. This methodology is based on the increase of fluorescence polarization emission of a fluorescence-labeled PAT derivative on binding to specific antibodies.

Here, we developed an effective strategy based on combining major constituents' knockout with high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-QTOF-MS/MS) to comprehensively identify minor antioxidants in Malus doumeri, one of the longest known and most used tonic plant in Taiwan. First, five major compounds (I-V) in M. doumeri were knocked out by two-step stepwise high-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC). Second, minor antioxidants were screened by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-HPLC (DPPH-HPLC) assay. Third, structures of thirty minor antioxidants, including 11 dihydrochalcones, 4 flavanones, 3 flavonols, 2 flavones, 3 aurones and 7 phenolic acids, were unambiguously or tentatively identified by matching their characteristic UV spectra, accurate mass signals and key diagnostic fragment ions with standards or previously reported compounds. Twenty-six of them, as far as was known, were discovered from M. doumeri for the first time.

25862456,"Upon pathogen attack, fruit trees such as apple (Malus spp.) and pear (Pyrus spp.) accumulate biphenyl and dibenzofuran phytoalexins, with aucuparin as a major biphenyl compound. 4-Hydroxylation of the biphenyl scaffold, formed by biphenyl synthase (BIS), is catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 (CYP). The biphenyl 4-hydroxylase (B4H) coding sequence of rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) was isolated and functionally expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). SaB4H was named CYP736A107. No catalytic function of CYP736 was known previously. SaB4H exhibited absolute specificity for 3-hydroxy-5-methoxybiphenyl. In rowan cell cultures treated with elicitor from the scab fungus, transient increases in the SaB4H, SaBIS, and phenylalanine ammonia lyase transcript levels preceded phytoalexin accumulation. Transient expression of a carboxyl-terminal reporter gene construct directed SaB4H to the endoplasmic reticulum. A construct lacking the amino-terminal leader and transmembrane domain caused cytoplasmic localization. Functional B4H coding sequences were also isolated from two apple (Malus × domestica) cultivars. The MdB4Hs were named CYP736A163. When stems of cv Golden Delicious were infected with the fire blight bacterium, highest MdB4H transcript levels were observed in the transition zone. In a phylogenetic tree, the three B4Hs were closest to coniferaldehyde 5-hydroxylases involved in lignin biosynthesis, suggesting a common ancestor.

25849252,"Erwinia amylovora is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes the destructive disease fire blight affecting most members of the Rosaceae family, of which apple and pear are economically the most important hosts. E. amylovora has been considered as a homogeneous species in whole, although significant differences in virulence patterns have been observed. However, the underlying causes of the differences in virulence remain to be discovered. In a first-time comparative proteomic approach using E. amylovora, 2D differential in-gel electrophoresis (DIGE) was used to identify proteins that could explain the gradual difference in virulence between four different strains. Two important proteins were identified, FliC and CheY, both involved in flagella structure, motility and chemotaxis, which were more abundant in the least virulent strain. In the highly virulent strains the protein GalF, involved in amylovoran production, was more abundant, which was consistent with the higher expression of the gene and the higher amylovoran content in this strain in vitro. Together, these results confirm the involvement of amylovoran in virulence, but also imply an indirect role of flagellin in virulence as elicitor of plant defence.",Journal of proteomics,"['D001426', 'D002633', 'D002853', 'D015180', 'D044084', 'D005407', 'D005408', 'D020869', 'D005798', 'D018515', 'D018520', 'D011135', 'D020543', 'D031989', 'D013045', 'D053719', 'D014774', 'D037521']","['Bacterial Proteins', 'Chemotaxis', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Erwinia amylovora', 'Flagella', 'Flagellin', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, Bacterial', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plant Shoots', 'Polysaccharides, Bacterial', 'Proteome', 'Pyrus', 'Species Specificity', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Virulence', 'Virulence Factors']","A comparative proteome analysis reveals flagellin, chemotaxis regulated proteins and amylovoran to be involved in virulence differences between Erwinia amylovora strains.","['Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000166', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000382', 'Q000382', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000382', None, None, None, 'Q000378']","['metabolism', None, None, None, 'cytology', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None, 'microbiology', 'microbiology', 'metabolism', None, 'microbiology', None, None, None, 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25849252,2016,0,0,bacteria,apple,0.05172413793103448,['amylovoran'],1,3
25832782,"Patulin is a mycotoxin commonly found in certain fruit and fruit products. For this reason many countries have established regulatory limits pertaining to, in particular, apple juice and apple products. Fruit leathers are produced by dehydrating fruit puree, leaving a sweet product that has a leathery texture. A recent report in the literature described the detection of patulin at substantial levels in fruit leathers. To investigate this further, an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array (UPLC-PDA) method was developed for the sensitive detection of patulin in fruit leathers. Investigations were also made of the suitability of direct analysis in real time-mass spectrometry (DART-MS) for detection of patulin from the surface of fruit leathers. Results indicated DART-MS was insufficiently sensitive for quantification from the surface of home-style apple leathers, although patulin spiked onto the surface of leather or peel could be detected. The UPLC-PDA method was used to determine the fate of patulin during the preparation of home-made fruit leathers. Interestingly, when a home-style process was used, the patulin was not destroyed, but rather increased in concentration as the puree was dehydrated. The UPLC-PDA method was also used to screen for patulin in commercial fruit leathers. Of the 36 products tested, 14 were above the limit of detection (3.5 μg kg(-1)) and nine were above the limit of quantification (12 μg kg(-1)). Positive samples were confirmed by UPLC-MS/MS. Only one sample was found above the US regulatory limit for single-strength apple juice products (50 μg kg(-1)). These results suggest patulin can be concentrated during preparation and can be found in fruit leathers. The limited survey suggests that patulin is fairly prevalent in such commercial products, but that the levels are usually low.","Food additives & contaminants.

25800179,"In this study, a polarization-induced electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was developed. A micro-sized sample droplet was deposited on a naturally available dielectric substrate such as a fruit or a stone, and then placed close to (~2 mm) the orifice of a mass spectrometer applied with a high voltage. Taylor cone was observed from the sample droplet, and a spray emitted from the cone apex was generated. The analyte ion signals derived from the droplet were obtained by the mass spectrometer. The ionization process is similar to that in ESI although no direct electric contact was applied on the sample site. The sample droplet polarized by the high electric field provided by the mass spectrometer initiated the ionization process. The dielectric sample loading substrate facilitated further the polarization process, resulting in the formation of Taylor cone. The mass spectral profiles obtained via this approach resembled those obtained using ESI-MS. Multiply charged ions dominated the mass spectra of peptides and proteins, whereas singly charged ions dominated the mass spectra of small molecules such as amino acids and small organic molecules. In addition to liquid samples, this approach can be used for the analysis of solid and viscous samples. A small droplet containing suitable solvent (5-10 µl) was directly deposited on the surface of the solid (or viscous) sample, placed close the orifice of mass spectrometer applied with a high voltage.

In this way, we could increase the ion yields for numerous lipid classes, liposoluble vitamins, and saccharides, imaged in animal and plant tissue with a 5-micrometer-wide laser spot, by up to two orders of magnitude. Critical parameters for initiation of the secondary ionization processes are pressure of the cooling gas in the ion source, laser wavelength, pulse energy, and delay between the two laser pulses.

How ever, when inoculated on peach, strain 726 shows yeast-like to pseudohyphal transition coupled to a pathogenic behaviour. To identify the proteins potentially involved in such transition process, a comparative proteome analysis of P. fermentans 726 developed on peach (filamentous growth) vs apple (yeast-like growth) was carried out using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry analysis. The proteome comparison was also performed between the two different cell morphologies induced in a liquid medium amended with urea (yeast-like cells) or methionine (filamentous cells) to exclude fruit tissue impact on the transition. Seventy-three protein spots showed significant variations in abundance (±twofold, p < 0.01, confidence intervals 99 %) between pseudohyphal vs yeast-like morphology produced on fruits. Among them, 30 proteins changed their levels when the two morphologies were developed in liquid medium.

25678319,"A challenge in coupling high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) online with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for purity analysis was their time incompatibility. Consequently, HSCCC-HPLC was conducted by either controlling HPLC analysis time and HSCCC flow rate or using stop-and-go scheme. For natural products containing compounds with a wide range of polarities, the former would optimize experimental conditions, while the latter required more time. Here, a novel HSCCC-HPLC-diode array detector-mass spectrometry (HSCCC-HPLC-DAD-MS) was developed for undisrupted purification, analysis and identification of multi-compounds from natural products. Two six-port injection valves and a six-port switching valve were used as interface for collecting key HSCCC effluents alternatively for HPLC-DAD-MS analysis and identification.

The xylo-gluco-oligosaccharides (XylGos) released were separated on CarboPac PA 200 column in less than 15 min, and, after purification, they were structurally characterized by negative electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI-Q-TOF), a hybrid linear ion trap (LTQ)/Orbitrap and a hybrid quadrupole Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometers. In order to corroborate the fragmentation routes observed on XylGos, some commercial galacto-manno-oligosaccharides (GalMOs) and glucurono-xylo-oligosaccharides were also studied. The fragmentation pathways of the ionized GalMos were similar to those of XylGos ones. The product ion spectra were mainly characterized by prominent double cleavage (D) ions corresponding to the entire inner side chains. The directed fragmentation from the reducing end to the other end was observed for the main glycosylated backbone but also for the side-chains, allowing their complete sequencing. Relevant cross-ring cleavage ions from (0,2)X(j)-type revealed to be diagnostic of the 1-2-linked- glycosyl units from XylGos together with the 1-2-linked glucuronic acid unit from glucuronoxylans. Resonant activation in the LTQ Orbitrap allowed not only determining the type of all linkages but also the O-acetyl group location on fucosylated side-chains. Moreover, the fragmentation of the different side chains using the MS(n) capabilities of the LTQ/Orbitrap analyzer also allowed differentiating terminal arabinosyl and xylosyl substituents inside S and U side-chains of XylGos, respectively. The CID spectra obtained were very informative for distinction of isomeric structures differing only in their substitution pattern.

25587929,"Staphylococcus aureus is one of the common pathogenic bacteria responsible for bacterial infectious diseases and food poisoning. This study presents an analytical method based on the affinity nanoprobe-based mass spectrometry that enables detection of S. aureus in aqueous samples. A peptide aptamer DVFLGDVFLGDEC (DD) that can recognize S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was used as the reducing agent and protective group to generate DD-immobilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs@DD) from one-pot reactions. The thiol group from cysteine in the peptide aptamer, i.e., DD, can interact with gold ions to generate DD-immobilized AuNPs in an alkaline solution. The generated AuNPs@DD has an absorption maximum at ∼518 nm. The average particle size is 7.6 ± 1.2 nm. Furthermore, the generated AuNPs@DD can selectively bind with S. aureus and MRSA. The conjugates of the target bacteria with AuNPs were directly analyzed by surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (SALDI-MS). The gold ions generated from the AuNPs@DD anchored on the target bacteria were monitored. Gold ions (m/z 197 and 394) were only generated from the conjugates of the target bacterium-AuNP@DD in the SALDI process. Thus, the gold ions could be used as the indicators for the presence of the target bacteria. The detection limit of S. aureus using this method is in the order of a few tens of cells. The low detection limit is due to the ease of generation of gold cluster ion derived from AuNPs under irradiation with a 355 nm laser beam. Apple juice mixed with S. aureus was used as the sample to demonstrate the suitability of the method for real-world application.

25560914,"Alternaria core rot is a major postharvest disease of apple fruit in several countries of the world, including Greece. The study was conducted aiming to identify the disease causal agents at species level, investigate the aggressiveness of Alternaria spp. isolates and the susceptibility of different apple varieties and determine the mycotoxigenic potential of Alternaria spp. isolates from apple fruit. Seventy-five Alternaria spp. isolates obtained from apple fruit showing core rot symptoms were identified as either Alternaria tenuissima or Alternaria arborescens at frequencies of 89.3 and 11.7%, respectively, based on the sequence of endopolygalacturonase (EndoPG) gene. Artificial inoculations of fruit of 4 different varieties (Fuji, Golden Delicious, Granny Smith and Red Delicious) and incubation at two different temperatures (2 and 25°C) showed that fruit of Fuji variety were the most susceptible and fruit of Golden Delicious the most resistant to both pathogens. In addition, the production of 3 mycotoxins, alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME) and tentoxin (TEN) was investigated in 30 isolates of both species. Mycotoxin determination was conducted both in vitro, on artificial nutrient medium and in vivo on artificially inoculated apple fruit, using a high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). The results showed that most of the isolates of both species were able to produce all the 3 metabolites both in vivo and in vitro. On apple fruit A. tenuissima isolates produced more AOH than A. arborescens isolates, whereas the latter produced more TEN than the former. Such results indicate that Alternaria core rot represents a major threat of apple fruit production not only due to quantitative yield losses but also for qualitative deterioration of apple by-products.

Fructose and sucrose represented the major components of soluble sugars in cultivated fruits, whilst fructose and glucose were the major items of sugars in wild fruits. Wild fruits were significantly more acidic than cultivated fruits, whilst the average concentration of total sugars and sweetness index were quite similar between cultivated and wild fruits. Thus, our study suggests that fruit acidity rather than sweetness is likely to have undergone selection during apple domestication. Additionally, malic acid content was positively correlated with glucose content and negatively correlated with sucrose content. This suggests that selection of fruit acidity must have an effect on the proportion of sugar components in apple fruits.

Specific monomers were released at their original location in the tissue, suggesting that post-hydrolysis diffusion can be neglected. Relative quantification of the species was achieved by introducing an internal standard, and the collection of data was subjected to non-supervised and supervised statistical treatments. The molecular images obtained showed a specific distribution of ions that could unambiguously be ascribed to cutinized and suberized regions observed at the surface of fruit cuticles, thus demonstrating that the method is able to probe some structural changes that affect hydrophobic cuticle polymers. Subsequent chemical assignment of the differentiating ions was performed, and all of these ions could be matched to cutin and suberin molecular markers.

25260190,"Recent studies have shown that there are detectable levels of arsenic (As) in rice, rice food products, and apple juice. This has created significant concern to the public, the food industry, and various regulatory bodies. Classic test methods typically measure total As and are unable to differentiate the various As species. Since different As species have greatly different toxicities, an analytical method was needed to separate and quantify the different inorganic and organic species of As. The inorganic species arsenite [As(+3)] and arsenate [As(+5)] are highly toxic. With this in mind, an ion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma (IC-ICP/MS) method was developed and validated for rice and rice food products that can separate and individually measure multiple inorganic and organic species of As. This allows for the evaluation of the safety or risk associated with any product analyzed. The IC-ICP/MS method was validated on rice and rice food products, and it has been used successfully on apple juice.

25260164,"The presence of pesticide residues in apples raises serious health concerns, especially when the fresh fruits are consumed by children, particularly vulnerable to the pesticide hazards. This study demonstrates the results from nine years of investigation (2005-2013) of 696 samples of Polish apples for 182 pesticides using gas and liquid chromatography and spectrophotometric techniques. Only 33.5% of the samples did not contain residues above the limit of detection. In 66.5% of the samples, 34 pesticides were detected, of which maximum residue level (MRL) was exceeded in 3%. Multiple residues were present in 35% of the samples with two to six pesticides, and one sample contained seven compounds. A study of the health risk for children, adults and the general population consuming apples with these pesticides was performed. The pesticide residue data have been combined with the consumption of apples in the 97.5 percentile and the mean diet. A deterministic model was used to assess the chronic and acute exposures that are based on the average and high concentrations of residues. Additionally, the ""worst-case scenario"" and ""optimistic case scenario"" were used to assess the chronic risk. In certain cases, the total dietary pesticide intake calculated from the residue levels observed in apples exceeds the toxicological criteria. Children were the group most exposed to the pesticides, and the greatest short-term hazard stemmed from flusilazole at 624%, dimethoate at 312%, tebuconazole at 173%, and chlorpyrifos methyl and captan with 104% Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) each. In the cumulative chronic exposure, among the 17 groups of compounds studied, organophosphate insecticides constituted 99% acceptable daily intake (ADI). The results indicate that the occurrence of pesticide residues in apples could not be considered a serious public health problem. Nevertheless, an investigation into continuous monitoring and tighter regulation of pesticide residues is recommended.

25254921,"Trichothecenes are one of the most important groups of mycotoxins produced by Trichothecium roseum, which causes core rot of apple. A reliable and sensitive method was developed and successfully applied for the rapid detection of trichothecenes including T-2 toxin and neosolaniol in harvested apple using UPLC-MS/MS. After the extraction of the two mycotoxins from the apple matrix with methanol/water (80/20, v/v), the concentrated extracts were cleaned-up by PriboFast M270 columns and then analysed by UPLC-MS/MS. T-2 toxin and neosolaniol were effectively separated as unique peaks. The validity of this method was established by its linearity (R(2) ≥ 0.9995), precision (relative standard deviation ≤ 3.6%), accuracy, selectivity, limit of detection of 2-5 μg kg(-1), limit of quantification of 5-10 μg kg(-1) and average recovery of 73-96%. Levels of T-2 toxin were found in the range 7.1-128.4 µg kg(-1) in the core rot lesion of three cultivars apple (cvs. Red Delicious, Fuji and Ralls). T-2 was detected not only in the lesion, but also in the tissue without any disease symptoms. However, neosolaniol was only detected in the lesion on 'Red Delicious' apples. In addition, the concentration of T-2 toxin in the susceptible cultivar (cv. Fuji) was significantly higher than that in the resistant one (cv. Ralls).

25175039,"An LC-MS/MS ""dilute and shoot"" method for the determination of 295 fungal and bacterial metabolites was optimized and validated according to the guidelines established in the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Affairs of the European Commission (SANCO) document No. 12495/2011. Four different types of food matrices were chosen for validation: apple puree for infants (high water content), hazelnuts (high fat content), maize (high starch and low fat content) and green pepper (difficult or unique matrix). Method accuracy and precision was evaluated using spiked samples in five replicates at two concentration levels. Method trueness was demonstrated through participation in various proficiency tests. Although the method covers a total number of 331 analytes, validation data were acquired only for 295 analytes, either due to the non-availability of analytical standards or due other reasons described in this paper. Concerning the apparent recovery, the percentage of 295 analytes matching the acceptable recovery range of 70-120% lied down by SANCO varied from 21% in green pepper to 74% in apple puree at the highest spiking level. At the levels close to limit of quantification only 20-58% of the analytes fulfilled this criterion. The extent of matrix effects was strongly dependent on the analyte/matrix combination. In general, the lowest matrix effects were observed in apple puree (59% of analytes were not influenced by enhancement/suppression at all at the highest validation level). The highest matrix effects were observed in green pepper, where only 10% of analytes did not suffer from signal suppression/enhancement. The repeatability of the method was acceptable (RSD≤20) for 97% of all analytes in apple puree and hazelnuts, for 95% in maize and for 89% in green pepper. Concerning the trueness of the method, Z-scores were generally between -2 and 2, despite a broad variety of different matrices.

25163933,"This article focuses on finding the novel antibrowning agents from the pine needles of Cedrus deodara and studying its antibrowning effect. By bioassay guide of tyrosinase inhibitory activity, the main active compound was isolated and purified from 50% methanol extract of pine needles of C. deodara through macroporous resin Diaion HP-20 column chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. Based on mass and nuclear magnetic resonance data, the active compound was identified as 2R,3R-dihydromyricetin, which showed the potent monophenolase and diphenolase inhibitory activities. Moreover, 2R,3R-dihydromyricetin exhibited a strong ABTS radical scavenging activity with a dose-dependent manner. The antibrowning efficacy of 2R,3R-dihydromyricetin was evaluated by monitoring the changes of L*, a*, and b* values and total color difference (△E) on fresh-cut apple slices. It was found that 2R,3R-dihydromyricetin was effective in inhibiting the browning of apple slices treated with a concentration as low as 0.05% at 25 °C for 24 h. Its antibrowning effect was significantly better than ascorbic acid (0.5%) alone. Furthermore, 2R,3R-dihydromyricetin showed a good synergistic antibrowning effect with ascorbic acid. This is the first report that 2R,3R-dihydromyricetin from pine needles of C. deodara may be used as a potential antibrowning agent in protecting against food browning.

It was determined that bare MNPs have excellent function as adsorbent when purified, and it is better to be separated from the extract. The amount of MNPs influenced the clean-up performance and recoveries. To achieve the optimum performance of modified QuEChERS towards the target analytes, several parameters including the amount of the adsorbents and purification time were investigated. Under the optimum conditions, recoveries were evaluated in four representative matrices (tomato, cucumber, orange and apple) with the spiked concentrations of 10 μg kg(-1), 50 μg kg(-1)and 200 μg kg(-1) in all cases. The results showed that the recovery of 101 pesticides ranged between 71.5 and 111.7%, and the relative standard deviation was less than 10.5%. The optimum clean-up system improved the purification efficiency and simultaneously obtained satisfactory recoveries of multiple pesticides, including planar-ring pesticides.

25146528,"Despite the relationship between melatonin and aging, the overall changes and regulation of proteome profiling by long-term melatonin exposure during leaf senescence is not well understood. In this study, leaf senescence in Malus hupehensis plants was delayed when exogenous melatonin was regularly applied to the roots for 2 months compared with natural leaf senescence. Proteins of samples 0 and 50 day for both treatments were extracted and labeled with TMT regents before being examined via NanoLC-MS/MS. The proteomics data showed that 622 and 309 proteins were altered by senescence and melatonin, respectively. Our GO analysis by Blast2GO revealed that most of the altered proteins that are involved in major metabolic processes exhibited hydrolase activity and were mainly located in the plastids. These proteins were classified into several senescence-related functional categories, including degradation of macromolecules, redox and stress responses, transport, photosynthesis, development, and other regulatory proteins. We found that melatonin treatment led to the downregulation of proteins that are normally upregulated during senescence. The melatonin-related delay in senescence might have occurred due to the altering of proteins involved in processes associated with senescence. And as well, there are many unknown regulatory proteins possibly being involved in the melatonin's function.

The initial detection of components in a matrix was done by a high resolution mass spectrum deconvolution; the preliminary identification of suspected pesticides was based on a special retention index/mass spectrum (RI/MS) library that contained both the first-stage mass spectra (MS(1) spectra) and retention indices; and the final confirmation was accomplished by accurate mass measurements of representative ions with their response ratios from the MS(1) spectra or representative product ions from the second-stage mass spectra (MS(2) spectra). To evaluate the applicability of the workflow in real samples, three matrices of apple, spinach, and scallion, each spiked with 165 test pesticides in a set of concentrations, were selected as the models. The results showed that the use of high-resolution TOF enabled effective extractions of spectra from noisy chromatograms, which was based on a narrow mass window (5 mDa) and suspected-target compounds identified by the similarity match of deconvoluted full mass spectra and filtering of linear RIs. On average, over 74% of pesticides at 50 ng/mL could be identified using deconvolution and the RI/MS library. Over 80% of pesticides at 5 ng/mL or lower concentrations could be confirmed in each matrix using at least two representative ions with their response ratios from the MS(1) spectra. In addition, the application of product ion spectra was capable of confirming suspected pesticides with specificity for some pesticides in complicated matrices. In conclusion, GC-QTOF MS combined with the RI/MS library seems to be one of the most efficient tools for the analysis of suspected-target pesticide residues in complicated matrices.",Talanta,"['D008401', 'D013058', 'D010573', 'D010575', 'D015203']","['Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Pesticides', 'Reproducibility of Results']",Suspected-target pesticide screening using gas chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry with high resolution deconvolution and retention index/mass spectrum library.,"['Q000295', 'Q000295', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None]","['instrumentation', 'instrumentation', 'analysis', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25059143,2015,0,0,spiked apple,apple,0.05952380952380952,"['pesticides', 'pesticide']",1,5

In this study, two nitrogen (N) fertilizer treatments were designed--without (CK) or with (SN) synthetic N fertilizers (800 kg N ha(-1)). The annual cumulative N2O emissions from CK and SN were 34.6 ± 3.0 (mean ± standard error) and 44.3 ± 6.0 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively. Such high emissions resulted from the intensive N fertilization in the experimental and previous years. The direct emission factor (EFd) of N2O induced by the applied synthetic N fertilizers was 1.2%. The EFd is within the range of previous studies carried out in other croplands, which suggests that it is reasonable to estimate regional N2O emissions from apple orchards using the EFd obtained in other croplands.

25047819,"The ""quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe"" (QuEChERS) approach to sample preparation is widely applied in pesticide residue analysis, but the use of magnesium sulfate and other nonvolatile compounds for salting out in the method is not ideal for mass spectrometry. In this study, we developed and evaluated three new different versions of the QuEChERS method using more volatile salts (ammonium chloride and ammonium formate and acetate buffers) to induce phase separation and extraction of 43 representative pesticide analytes of different classes. Fast low-pressure gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LPGC-MS/MS) and liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS were used for analysis. The QuEChERS AOAC Official Method 2007.01 was also tested for comparison purposes. Of the studied methods, formate buffering using 7.5g of ammonium formate and 15mL of 5% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile for the extraction of 15g of sample (5g for wheat grain) provided the best performance and practical considerations. Method validation was carried out with and without the use of dispersive solid-phase extraction for cleanup, and no significant differences were observed for the majority of pesticides. The method was demonstrated in quantitative analysis for GC- and LC-amenable pesticides in 4 representative food matrices (apple, lemon, lettuce, and wheat grain). With the typical exceptions of certain pH-dependent and labile pesticides, 90-110% recoveries and <10% RSD were obtained.

P. caribbica showed susceptibility to the oxidative stress in vitro test, and 250 μg/mL VC treatment improved its oxidative stress tolerance. The higher viability exhibited by VC-treated yeast was associated with a lower intracellular ROS level. The activities of antioxidant enzymes of P. caribbica were improved by VC treatment, including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). Additionally, VC-treated yeast exhibited greater biocontrol activity against P. expansum and faster growth when stored at 25 and 4 °C, respectively, compared to the performance of the non-VC-treated yeast. In response to the VC treatment under oxidative stress, several differentially expressed proteins were identified in P. caribbica, and most of the poteins were confirmed to be related to basic metabolism.

However, their combined effects are not well documented. It was hypothesized that the beneficial properties of quercetin glycosides can be enhanced when provided in combination with n-3 PUFA. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of apple flavonols (AF) and fish oil (FO), alone and in combination, on proinflammatory biomarkers and lipid profiles in rats fed a high-fat diet. Sixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 12) and fed a high-fat diet for 4 weeks. One of the 5 groups of rats was used as the high-fat control. The other 4 groups of rats were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (5 mg/kg body weight) intraperitoneally, 5 hours before euthanization. One of these 4 groups was used as the hypercholerolemic and inflammatory control (high-fat with lipopolysaccharide [HFL]), and the other 3 received AF (HFL + 25 mg/kg per day AF), FO (HFL + 1 g/kg per day FO), or the combination (HFL + AF + FO). Compared to the HFL group, the AF, FO, and AF + FO groups showed lower serum concentrations of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The AF, FO, and AF + FO also had lowered serum triacylglycerol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations, but higher HDL-C levels relative to the HFL group. An additive effect was observed on serum CRP in the AF + FO group as compared with the AF or FO groups. The results demonstrated that AF and FO inhibited the production of proinflammatory mediators and showed an improved efficacy to lower serum CRP when administered in combination, and they significantly improved blood lipid profiles in rats with diet-induced hyperlipidemia and LPS-induced acute inflammation.","Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)","['D000208', 'D052242', 'D000818', 'D015415', 'D001835', 'D002097', 'D008076', 'D059305', 'D015525', 'D005395', 'D044948', 'D006937', 'D007249', 'D007371', 'D016753', 'D015850', 'D008070', 'D008099', 'D008297', 'D027845', 'D009929', 'D051381', 'D017208', 'D053719', 'D014280', 'D014409']","['Acute Disease', 'Adiponectin', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Body Weight', 'C-Reactive Protein', 'Cholesterol, HDL', 'Diet, High-Fat', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-3', 'Fish Oils', 'Flavonols', 'Hypercholesterolemia', 'Inflammation', 'Interferon-gamma', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-6', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Liver', 'Male', 'Malus', 'Organ Size', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Triglycerides', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",Apple flavonols and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid-rich fish oil lowers blood C-reactive protein in rats with hypercholesterolemia and acute inflammation.,"[None, 'Q000097', None, 'Q000097', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000097', 'Q000009', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000494', 'Q000188', 'Q000188', 'Q000097', 'Q000097', 'Q000097', 'Q000008', 'Q000187', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000187', None, None, None, 'Q000097', 'Q000097']","[None, 'blood', None, 'blood', None, 'metabolism', 'blood', 'adverse effects', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'pharmacology', 'drug therapy', 'drug therapy', 'blood', 'blood', 'blood', 'administration & dosage', 'drug effects', None, 'chemistry', 'drug effects', None, None, None, 'blood', 'blood']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25026921,2015,0,0,rat blood,apple,0.17796610169491525,"['lipopolysaccharide', 'polyunsaturated fatty acids', 'quercetin glycosides', 'FO', 'triacylglycerol', 'cholesterol', 'n-3 PUFA', 'apple flavonols']",1,21
25013119,"The 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway provides the precursors for the biosynthesis of plastidial isoprenoids, which include the carotenoid pigments of many fruits. We have analysed the genes encoding the seven enzymes of the MEP pathway in melon (Cucumis melo L.) and determined that the first one, 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), and the last one, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase (HDR), are represented in the genome as a small gene family and paralogous pair, respectively. In the case of DXS, three genes encode functional DXS activities which fall into previously established type I (CmDXS1) and II (CmDXS2a and CmDXS2b) categories, while a fourth DXS-like gene belonging to the type III group did not encode a protein with DXS activity. Their expression patterns and phylogenies suggest that CmDXS1 is functionally specialized for developmental and photosynthetic processes, while CmDXS2a and CmDXS2b are induced in flowers and ripening fruit of orange- (but not white-) fleshed varieties, coinciding with β-carotene accumulation. This is the first instance connecting type II DXS genes to specialized isoprenoid biosynthesis in the fruit of an agronomically important species. Two HDR paralogues were shown to encode functional enzymes, although only CmHDR1 was highly expressed in the tissues and developmental stages tested. Phylogenetic analysis showed that in cucurbits such as melon, these HDR paralogues probably arose through individual gene duplications in a common angiosperm ancestor, mimicking a prior division in gymnosperms, while other flowering plants, including apple, soy, canola, and poplar, acquired HDR duplicates recently as homoeologues through large-scale genome duplications. We report the influence of gene duplication history on the regulation of the MEP pathway in melon and the role of specialized MEP-pathway isoforms in providing precursors for β-carotene production in orange-fleshed melon varieties.

In this work, the nonrandom two-liquid (NRTL) model, a thermodynamic method, was used for predicting the partition coefficient based on a few measured partition coefficients. The NRTL method provides quite satisfactory results for model solutes in first correlating measured partition coefficient in a few representative biphasic liquid systems and then successfully predicting partition coefficient in other two-phase liquid systems. According to the predicted partition coefficient, a suitable solvent system can be screened.

The results demonstrated that the NRTL model can offer a simple and practical strategy to estimate partition coefficients in support of CCC solvent system selection, which will significantly minimize the experimental efforts and cost involved in solvent system selection.

24944043,"'Soggy breakdown' (SB) is an internal flesh disorder of 'Honeycrisp' apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) fruit that occurs during low temperature storage. The disorder is a chilling injury (CI) in which visible symptoms typically appear after several weeks of storage, but information about the underlying metabolism associated with its induction and development is lacking. The metabolic profile of flesh tissue from wholly healthy fruit and brown and healthy tissues from fruit with SB was characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and correlation networks revealed correlation among ester volatile compounds by composition and differences in phytosterol, phenolic and putative triacylglycerides (TAGs) metabolism among the tissues. anova-simultaneous component analysis (ASCA) was used to test the significance of metabolic changes linked with tissue health status. ASCA-significant components included antioxidant compounds, TAGs, and phytosterol conjugates. Relative to entirely healthy tissues, elevated metabolite levels in symptomatic tissue included γ-amino butyric acid, glycerol, sitosteryl (6'-O-palmitoyl) β-d-glucoside and sitosteryl (6'-O-stearate) β-d-glucoside, and TAGs containing combinations of 16:0, 18:3, 18:2 and 18:1 fatty acids. Reduced metabolite levels in SB tissue included 5-caffeoyl quinate, β-carotene, catechin, epicatechin, α-tocopherol, violaxanthin and sitosteryl β-d glucoside. Pathway analysis indicated aspects of primary metabolism differed according to tissue condition, although differences in metabolites involved were more subtle than those of some secondary metabolites. The results implicate oxidative stress and membrane disruption processes in SB development and constitute a diagnostic metabolic profile for the disorder.

24828980,"An atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source has been used to enhance the potential of gas chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometry (MS) for screening and quantification purposes in pesticide residue analysis. A screening method developed in our laboratory for around 130 pesticides has been applied to fruit and vegetable samples, including strawberries, oranges, apples, carrots, lettuces, courgettes, red peppers, and tomatoes. Samples were analyzed together with quality control samples (at 0.05 mg/kg) for each matrix and for matrix-matched calibration standards. The screening strategy consisted in first rapid searching and detection, and then a refined identification step using the QTOF capabilities (MS(E) and accurate mass). Identification was based on the presence of one characteristic m/z ion (Q) obtained with the low collision energy function and at least one fragment ion (q) obtained with the high collision energy function, both with mass errors of less than 5 ppm, and an ion intensity ratio (q/Q) within the tolerances permitted. Following this strategy, 15 of 130 pesticides were identified in the samples. Afterwards, the quantitation capabilities were tested by performing a quantitative validation for those pesticides detected in the samples. To this aim, five matrices were selected (orange, apple, tomato, lettuce, and carrot) and spiked at two concentrations (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg), and quantification was done using matrix-matched calibration standards (relative responses versus triphenyl phosphate used as an internal standard). Acceptable average recoveries and relative standard deviations were obtained for many but not all pesticide-matrix combinations. These figures allowed us to perform a retrospective quantification of positives found in the screening without the need for additional analysis. Taking advantage of the accurate-mass full-spectrum data provided by QTOF MS, we searched for a higher number of compounds (up to 416 pesticides) in a second stage by performing extra data processing without any new sample injection. Several more pesticides were detected, confirmed, and/or tentatively identified when the reference standard was unavailable, illustrating in this way the potential of gas chromatography-QTOF MS to detect pesticides in addition to the ones targeted in quantitative analysis of pesticides in food matrices.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,"['D001274', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D010573', 'D014675']","['Atmospheric Pressure', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Vegetables']",Screening and quantification of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables making use of gas chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization.,"[None, 'Q000737', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000737']","[None, 'chemistry', 'methods', 'analysis', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24828980,2015,0,0,spiked apple,apple,0.056074766355140186,"['pesticides', 'strawberries', 'triphenyl phosphate', '130 pesticides', 'chromatography-QTOF']",1,6

The identity of the nanomaterial was confirmed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. It was shown that Fe3O4 nanoparticles with a uniform size were homogeneously anchored on RGO nanosheets. Increased oxidation degrees of graphite oxide, big particle sizes and large loading amounts of Fe3O4 on the surface of RGO led to a decrease of adsorption capacity of MRGO to ICP. The adsorption behavior of this adsorbent was better fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Several parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were investigated and optimized, including adsorbent dosage, extraction time, ionic strength and desorption conditions. And then, a rapid and effective method based on MRGO combined with GC was developed for the determination of ICP in aqueous samples.

In this study, the GC-MS protocol for extracting and analyzing polar metabolites from apple tissue is optimized. We found pure methanol extraction to be slightly better as compared to the two phase methanol/chloroform/water extraction in terms of introducing less degradation of the extracted metabolites while being comparable in extraction efficiency and repeatability. The methanol extraction was superior to the single phase methanol/chloroform/water extraction in all performance measures. A multi-response optimization based on a desirability function was applied to optimize the derivatization. This procedure allows searching for optimal parameters while simultaneously considering overall detection enhancement of metabolites from various metabolic classes. A short oximation at a high temperature in combination with a low silylation temperature gave results similar to a longer oximation at low temperature in combination with a high silylation temperature.

24733672,"Ursolic acid (UA), a pentacyclic triterpene acid found in apple peels (Malus domestica, Borkh, Rosaceae), has a large spectrum of pharmacological effects. However, the vegetal matrix usually produces highly viscous and poorly soluble extracts that hamper the isolation of this compound. To overcome this problem, the crude EtOH-AcOEt extract of commercial apple peels was exhaustively treated with diazomethane, after which methyl ursolate (MU) was purified by column chromatography and characterized spectrometrically. The anti-inflammatory effects of UA and MU (50 mg/kg) were analyzed by zymosan-induced paw edema, pleurisy and in an experimental arthritis model. After 4 h of treatment with UA and MU, paw edema was reduced by 46 and 44 %, respectively. Both UA and MU inhibited protein extravasation into the thoracic cavity; tibio-femoral edema by 40 and 48 %, respectively; and leukocyte influx into the synovial cavity after 6 h by 52 and 73 %, respectively. Additionally, both UA and MU decreased the levels of mediators related to synovial inflammation, such as KC/CXCL-1 levels by 95 and 90 %, TNF-α levels by 76 and 71 %, and IL-1β levels by 57 and 53 %, respectively.

24728201,"Candidatus Phytoplasma mali' is a phytopathogenic bacterium of the family Acholeplasmataceae assigned to the class Mollicutes. This causative agent of the apple proliferation colonizes in Malus domestica the sieve tubes of the plant phloem resulting in a range of symptoms such as witches'--broom formation, reduced vigor and affecting size and quality of the crop. The disease is responsible for strong economical losses in Europe. Although the genome sequence of the pathogen is available, there is only limited information on expression of selected genes and metabolic key features that have not been examined on the transcriptomic or proteomic level so far. This situation is similar to many other phytoplasmas. In the work presented here, RNA-Seq and mass spectrometry shotgun techniques were applied on tissue samples from Nicotiana occidentalis infected by 'Ca. P. mali' strain AT providing insights into transcriptome and proteome of the pathogen. Data analysis highlights expression of 208 genes including 14 proteins located in the terminal inverted repeats of the linear chromosome. Beside a high portion of house keeping genes, the recently discussed chaperone GroES/GroEL is expressed. Furthermore, gene expression involved in formation of a type IVB and of the Sec-dependent secretion system was identified as well as the highly expressed putative pathogenicity-related SAP11-like effector protein. Metabolism of phytoplasmas depends on the uptake of spermidine/putescine, amino acids, co-factors, carbohydrates and in particular malate/citrate. The expression of these transporters was confirmed and the analysis of the carbohydrate cycle supports the suggested alternative energy-providing pathway for phytoplasmas releasing acetate and providing ATP. The phylogenetic analyses of malate dehydrogenase and acetate kinase in phytoplasmas show a closer relatedness to the Firmicutes in comparison to Mycoplasma species indicating an early divergence of the Acholeplasmataceae from the Mollicutes.",PloS one,"['D001426', 'D020869', 'D015964', 'D005798', 'D054884', 'D010802', 'D045582', 'D021382', 'D017433', 'D040901', 'D015203', 'D020133', 'D059467', 'D014774']","['Bacterial Proteins', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Genes, Bacterial', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Phylogeny', 'Phytoplasma', 'Protein Sorting Signals', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Proteomics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcriptome', 'Virulence']",Analysis of expressed genes of the bacterium 'Candidatus phytoplasma Mali' highlights key features of virulence and metabolism.,"['Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000235', None, 'Q000201', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235']","['chemistry', None, None, None, 'genetics', None, 'enzymology', None, None, None, None, None, 'genetics', 'genetics']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24728201,2015,0,0,phytopathogenic bacterium,apple,0.15217391304347827,"['carbohydrate', 'acetate', 'phytoplasmas', 'malate', 'carbohydrates', 'amino acids', 'IVB', 'spermidine/putescine', 'Ca', 'Acholeplasmataceae', 'ATP', 'SAP11-like']",1,14

Since not only fruit from organic farming, but also conventionally grown fruit is used for baby food production, the occurrence of pesticide residues in the final product is of high concern. To learn more about the fate of these hazardous compounds during processing of contaminated raw material, apples containing altogether 21 pesticide residues were used for preparation of a baby food purée both in the household and at industrial scale (in the baby food production facility). Within both studies, pesticide residues were determined in raw apples as well as in final products. Intermediate product and by-product were also analysed during the industrial process. Determination of residues was performed by a sensitive multi-detection analytical method based on liquid or gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The household procedure involved mainly the cooking of unpeeled apples, and the decrease of residues was not extensive enough for most of the studied pesticides; only residues of captan, dithianon and thiram dropped significantly (processing factors less than 0.04). On the other hand, changes in pesticide levels were substantial for all tested pesticides during apple processing in the industrial baby food production facility. The most important operation affecting the reduction of residues was removal of the by-products after pulping (rest of the peel, stem, pips etc.), while subsequent sterilisation has an insignificant effect. Also in this case, captan, dithianon and thiram were identified as pesticides with the most evident decrease of residues. ","Food additives & contaminants.

Here, we examined the relationship between toxin production and the pathogenicity of Vmm strains and determined their bioactivities in several assays, for further elucidating the pathogenesis mechanisms of Vmm and for developing new procedures to control this disease. The toxins were quantified with the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, and the results showed that the strain with attenuated virulence produced low levels of toxins with only three to four kinds of compounds being detectable. In contrast, higher amounts of toxins were produced by the more aggressive strain, and all five compounds were detected. This indicated a significant correlation between the pathogenicity of Vmm strains and their ability to produce toxins. However, this correlation only existed in planta, but not in vitro.

Phenolic compounds including procyanidins (i.e., condensed tannins) and anthocyanins were quantified in the fruits and juices of a red-fleshed apple cultivar by chromatography coupled to UV-visible and mass spectrometry. Juice color was characterized by colorimetry. The influence of oxygen, pH, sulfites, ascorbic acid, and copper on the color stability of the juice was studied in an experimental design. Fruits were rich in polyphenols (0.5 g/100 g FW), with anthocyanins and procyanidins accounting for 9 and 73% of total polyphenols, respectively. Extractability of anthocyanins in the juice was 26%. Juice storage under air atmosphere at 35 °C resulted in significant browning with the anthocyanin level decreasing up to 86% after 14 days.

24592995,"The ability of foods and beverages to reduce allyl methyl disulfide, diallyl disulfide, allyl mercaptan, and allyl methyl sulfide on human breath after consumption of raw garlic was examined. The treatments were consumed immediately following raw garlic consumption for breath measurements, or were blended with garlic prior to headspace measurements. Measurements were done using a selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometer. Chlorophyllin treatment demonstrated no deodorization in comparison to the control. Successful treatments may be due to enzymatic, polyphenolic, or acid deodorization. Enzymatic deodorization involved oxidation of polyphenolic compounds by enzymes, with the oxidized polyphenols causing deodorization. This was the probable mechanism in raw apple, parsley, spinach, and mint treatments. Polyphenolic deodorization involved deodorization by polyphenolic compounds without enzymatic activity. This probably occurred for microwaved apple, green tea, and lemon juice treatments. When pH is below 3.6, the enzyme alliinase is inactivated, which causes a reduction in volatile formation. This was demonstrated in pH-adjusted headspace measurements. However, the mechanism for volatile reduction on human breath (after volatile formation) is unclear, and may have occurred in soft drink and lemon juice breath treatments. Whey protein was not an effective garlic breath deodorant and had no enzymatic activity, polyphenolic compounds, or acidity. Headspace concentrations did not correlate well to breath treatments.

24484892,"Nowadays the trend in analytical chemistry is clearly towards the creation of multiple methods with extended coverage, enabling the determination of many different classes of compounds in a single analysis in which virtually all classes of different compounds are included in a single run. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a versatile and selective GC/MS/MS method for metabolite profiling of volatile compounds in apples, raspberries and grapes. Validation of the method was performed in terms of the limit of detection, limit of quantification, linearity range, and inter and intraday precision. Confirmation of the identity of the compounds in samples was carried out by checking compliance of the q/Q ratio of samples and reference standards. The multiple reaction monitoring with selection of two transition ions, one for quantification and one for confirmation, provided excellent selectivity and sensitivity, using the q/Q ratio as a confirmatory parameter. A multi target method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification and confirmation of 160 volatile compounds of raspberries, apples and grapes. The main classes were esters (42), alcohols (32), monoterpenes (31), aldehydes (17), ketones (12), norisoprenoids (8), acids (8), sesquiterpenes (7), pyrazines (3) and ethers (1) allowing the detection and quantification of 69 compounds in apples, 122 in grapes and 42 in raspberries.

The compound was purified from E. tasmaniensis strain Et1/99 supernatants by chromatography on Dowex-1 and Dowex-50 columns and identified by HPLC/MS and NMR analysis as 6-thioguanine (6TG). Its signal at 167 Da matched with the expected molecular mass. By random mutagenesis with miniTn5, we obtained mutants defective in the genes for pyrimidine and purine metabolism. A specific gene cluster with ycf genes described by us before, absent in the corresponding region of Escherichia coli, was identified in the genome sequence of three Erwinia species and named tgs region for thioguanine synthesis. Clones of the tgs gene cluster promoted 6TG synthesis and secretion in E. coli, when the bacteria were grown in minimal medium supplemented with amino acids. 6TG was bacteriostatic for E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium strains, with cell growth resumed after prolonged incubation. Similar results were obtained with P. agglomerans strains. Bacteria from the genus Pectobacterium were barely and Rahnella or Gibbsiella species were not inhibited by 6TG. Adenine and guanine relieved the toxic effect of 6TG on E. coli.

In this study, we used this approach to investigate photochemical activity during Malus micromalus leaf expansion. The results showed that as leaves expanded, the antenna size per reaction center for the two systems became smaller, and the energetic connectivity of PSII units decreased gradually. Meanwhile, the light trapping efficiency of PSII, electron transfer capacity at the donor side of PSII, exchange capacity of PQs at the QB site and the reoxidation capacity of PQH2 were all increased as leaves expanded. However, the capacity of PQH2 reoxidation increased at a slower rate than the exchange capacity of PQs at the QB site.

FASRAC (Food Automatic Analytical Systems for Residual Agricultural Chemicals) automatically performs extraction of pesticide residues from agricultural products with acetonitrile, filtration, constant volume, mixing with the use of air, mixing acetonitrile with buffer solvent, separation, and dehydration with sodium sulfate. The extract was purified with a GC/NH2 column. For wheat flour and soybeans, a purification step with a C18 column was added before a GC/NH2 column. After removal of the solvent, the extract was resolved in n-hexane/acetone solvent for GC-MS/MS analysis. In the case of manual analysis, pesticide residues were analyzed according to official multiresidue methods and purification steps were the same as in FASRAC. Recovery tests were performed with wheat flour, soybeans, spinach and apples, by addition of 302 pesticides at the concentrations 0.01 mg/kg.

In the present study, the total antioxidant capacity of different apple extracts obtained by pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE) was determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), which was compared with the conventional antioxidant assays. To measure the antioxidant capacity of individual antioxidants present in apple extracts, a novel method was developed based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with photodiode array (DAD), electrochemical (ECD), and charged aerosol (CAD) detection. HPLC-DAD-ECD-CAD enabled rapid, qualitative, and quantitative determination of antioxidants in the apple extracts. The main advantage of using CAD was that this detector enabled quantification of a large number of phenolics using only a few standards. The results showed that phenolic acids and flavonols were mainly responsible for the total antioxidant capacity of apple extracts.

Although three MdMYB genes, almost identical in nucleotide sequences, have been identified in apple, it is likely that there are other R2R3 MYB TFs that are present in the apple genome that are also involved in the regulation of coloration of red color pigmentation of the skin of apple fruits.",BMC plant biology,"['D000595', 'D000872', 'D002853', 'D002874', 'D003433', 'D035264', 'D020869', 'D018506', 'D017343', 'D027845', 'D013058', 'D008969', 'D010802', 'D010940', 'D030821', 'D020005', 'D017422', 'D014026', 'D014157']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anthocyanins', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Flowers', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genes, Plant', 'Malus', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Plant Proteins', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Propanols', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tobacco', 'Transcription Factors']","An apple MYB transcription factor, MdMYB3, is involved in regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis and flower development.","[None, 'Q000096', None, None, None, 'Q000254', None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000235', 'Q000737']","[None, 'biosynthesis', None, None, None, 'growth & development', None, None, 'genetics', 'genetics', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', None, 'genetics', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24199943,2014,0,0,apple MYB transcription factor,apple,0.09523809523809523,"['anthocyanins', 'Anthocyanin', 'nucleotide', 'anthocyanin']",1,4

For this purpose 202 clarified monovarietal juices extracted from apples differing in their botanical and geographical origin were used for evaluation of the performance of APCI-MS as a classification tool. For an independent test set PLS-DA analyses of pre-treated spectral data gave 100% and 94.2% correct classification rate for the classification by cultivar and geographical origin, respectively. Moreover, PLS-DA analysis of APCI-MS in conjunction with GC-MS data revealed that masses within the spectral ACPI-MS data set were related with parent ions or fragments of alkyesters, carbonyl compounds (hexanal, trans-2-hexenal) and alcohols (1-hexanol, 1-butanol, cis-3-hexenol) and had significant discriminating power both in terms of cultivar and geographical origin.

24088062,"The apple snail Pomacea canaliculata is a freshwater gastropod with a remarkable ability to withstand seasonal or unpredictable dry conditions by entering estivation. Studies of P. canaliculata using conventional biochemical and the individual gene approaches have revealed the expressional changes of several enzymes and antioxidative genes in response to estivation and arousal. In this study, we applied iTRAQ-coupled two-dimensional LC-MS/MS to identify and quantify the global protein expression during the estivation and arousal of P. canaliculata. A total of 1040 proteins were identified, among which 701 proteins were quantified and compared across four treatments (i.e., control, active snails; short-term estivation, 3 days of exposure to air; prolonged estivation, 30 days of exposure to air; and arousal, 6 h after resubmergence in water) revealing 53 differentially expressed proteins. A comparison of protein expression profiles across treatments indicated that the proteome of this species was very insensitive to initial estivation, with only 9 proteins differentially expressed as compared with the control. Among the 9 proteins, the up-regulations of two immune related proteins indicated the initial immune response to the detection of stress cues. Prolonged estivation resulted in many more differentially expressed proteins (47 compared with short-term estivation treatment), among which 16 were down-regulated and 31 were up-regulated. These differentially expressed proteins have provided the first global picture of a shift in energy usage from glucose to lipid, prevention of protein degradation and elevation of oxidative defense, and production of purine for uric acid production to remove toxic ammonia during prolonged estivation in a freshwater snail. From prolonged estivation to arousal, only 6 proteins changed their expression level, indicating that access to water and food alone is not a necessary condition to reactivate whole-sale protein expression.

To test the hypothesis that the fiber consumed in a regular diet affects fecal SCFA concentrations in the elderly, the authors investigated the association between different types of fiber intake and fecal SCFA concentrations in 32 institutionalized elderly subjects aged between 76 and 95 years. Food intake was recorded by means of a validated food frequency questionnaire. Total, soluble (pectin and hemicellulose) and insoluble (pectin, hemicellulose, Klason lignin, and cellulose) fiber was determined using Marlett Food Composition Tables. Analysis of acetic, propionic, and butyric acid concentrations was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Potato intake was directly associated with SCFA concentrations and apple intake with propionate concentration. Of the fibers, cellulose showed an independent association with acetate and butyrate concentrations, and insoluble pectin explained a part of the variation in propionate. In conclusion, our results provide further evidence regarding the relation between diet and SCFA concentration in the elderly. The identification of an association between the regular intake of foods such as potatoes and the production of SCFAs provides an opportunity to improve public health.

The capacity of patulin was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that Ca-alginate-AC beads have significant ability to reduce patulin from contaminated apple juice. Furthermore, the adsorption process did not affect the quality of apple juice. The effects of contact time, initial patulin concentration, adsorbent dose, and temperature were assessed. The removal percentage of patulin increased with contact time, adsorbent dose, and temperature. A reduction was also noted to bind patulin at increased levels of contamination. The equilibrium data were fitted to Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherm models and the isotherm constants were calculated at different temperatures. The adsorption equilibrium was best described by the Freundlich isotherm (R(2) > 0.990). The pseudo 1st-order model was found to describe the kinetic data satisfactorily. Thermodynamic parameters such as standard Gibbs free energy (ΔG◦◦), standard enthalpy (ΔH◦), and standard entropy (ΔS◦) were evaluated.

Chromatographic separation was achieved in less than 4min. Electrospray (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) sources were evaluated, in order to assess matrix effects. The use of ESI source caused strong signal suppression in samples; however, matrix effect was negligible using APCI, allowing quantification with calibration standards prepared in solvent. The method was validated in four different apple matrices (juice, fruit, puree and compote) at two concentrations at the low μgkg(-1) level.

The antiradical efficiency (AE) and the kinetic parameters (Efficient concentration/EC50 and time needed to reach the steady state to EC50 concentration/TEC50) of the DPPH curve were also evaluated for comparison with the Trolox equivalent (TE) values. A strong, significant and positive correlation was observed between the TE and AE values, whereas a weak and negative correlation was observed between TE and EC50, suggesting that the values of AE and TE are more useful for the determination of antiradical activity in fruits than the widely used EC50. The total phenolic content found in the fruits corresponded positively to their antioxidant activity. The high content of bioactive compounds (flavanols, anthocyanins or vitamin C) relative to the apple values found in araticum, cagaita, cajuzinho, jurubeba, lobeira, magaba and tucum corresponded to the high antioxidant activity of these fruits. Flavanols and anthocyanins may be the main bioactive components in these Cerrado fruits. The daily consumption of at least seven of the twelve Cerrado fruits studied, particularly, araticum, cagaita, lobeira and tucum, may confer protection against oxidative stress, and thus, they may prevent chronic diseases and premature aging.

Commercially available fiber coatings were evaluated by investigating the extraction efficiency and desorption carryover. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry was selected to map out the differences between the coatings. The investigated components were chosen to represent several homologous groups of metabolites most frequently present in complex food and environmental samples, including straight-chain hydrocarbons, primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, 2-ketones, aldehydes, ethyl esters, and terpenes. Particular emphasis was placed on examination of coating saturation and interanalyte displacements. These effects were assessed by evaluating the linear dynamic range obtained for spiked aqueous samples with divinylbenzene/Carboxen/poly(dimethylsiloxane) fiber. This coating was found to provide the optimum extraction coverage and sensitivity for the widest range of analytes. Displacement investigations were extended to apple homogenate characterized by high chemical diversity. The results indicate that interanalyte displacements are infrequent in the naturally occurring samples considered in this study. When displacements take place, they tend to occur for analytes characterized by small distribution constants, and they can be effectively detected by adding such compounds to the sample and corrected by selecting a shorter extraction time.

The UHPLC chromatographic system was chosen to separate polyphenolic compounds, and quantifications were then simultaneously performed with a UV-PDA detector and an ESI-triple quadrupole mass analyzer (SRM mode). Both quantification methods were validated for 15 major compounds using two apple juice samples, on the basis of linearity, limits of detection and quantification, recovery and precision tests. The comparison between UV and SRM quantifications in 120 different samples of a cider apple progeny showed an excellent correlation for major compounds quantified with both methods. However, an overestimation was revealed for five compounds with the UV detector and the mass analyzer. Co-elution and matrix effects are discussed to explain this phenomenon. SRM methods should therefore be considered with restrictions in some cases for quantification measurements when several phenolic compounds are simultaneously quantified in complex matrices such as apple juices. For both methods, analyses were carried out over short periods of time while maintaining a high quality for the simultaneous quantification of phenolic compounds in apple juice.

According to the results, adults did not show a behavioral response to red, yellow, purple, or white artificial flowers without food odors, but flowers with the fermented pear juice strongly attracted them, and they showed a behavioral response to fermented juices of the six fruits (pear, apple, banana, watermelon, orange, and persimmon) with no statistically significant preference. The fruit volatiles were collected using dynamic headspace adsorption, and the volatile components were analyzed by auto thermal-desorption gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to assess which volatiles existed in the fruits. Only alcohols, esters, and ketones were common in the volatiles of all six fermenting fruits. The five volatile components found in the six fruits, as well as two others found to be in other fermented foods by previous studies, were selected to test the behavioral and electroantennogram (EAG) responses of naive adults to estimate behavioral preference and antennal perception. In field behavioral tests, alcohols were the most attractive, followed by esters, while α-pinene, butanone, and acetic acid were much less attractive. Relative to other volatile combinations and ethanol alone, the mixture of ethyl acetate and ethanol attracted the most feeding adults. The number of adults attracted was significantly positively correlated with the concentration of both ethanol and ethyl acetate. The EAG responses of naive adults showed that the EAG responses to 3-methyl-1-butanol, isoamyl acetate, ethyl acetate, α-pinene, butanone, and acetic acid were all higher than those to ethanol (100%) at doses of either 5 µl/mL or 50 µl/mL.

23870934,"A procedure to detect whether carbon dioxide was added to French ciders has been developed. For this purpose, an optimised and simplified method is proposed to determine (13)C/(12)C isotope ratio of carbon dioxide (δ(13)C) in ciders. Three critical steps were checked: (1) influence of atmospheric CO2 remaining in the loaded vial, (2) impact of helium flush, (3) sampling speed. This study showed that atmospheric CO2 does not impact the measurement, that helium flush can lead to isotopic fractionation and finally, that a fractionation occurs only 5h after bottle opening. The method, without any other preparation, consists in sampling 0.2 mL of cold (4 °C) cider in a vial that is passed in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min at room temperature to enhance cider de-carbonation. The headspace CO2 is then analysed using the link Multiflow®-isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Each year, a data bank is developed by fermenting authentic apples juices in order to control cider authenticity. Over a four year span (2008-2011), the CO2 produced during the fermentation step was studied. This set of 61 authentic ciders, from various French production areas, was used to determine a δ(13)C value range of -22.59±0.92‰ for authentic ciders CO2 bubbles. 75 commercial ciders were analysed with this method. Most of the samples analysed present a gas δ(13)C value in the expected range. Nevertheless, some ciders have δ(13)C values outside the 3σ limit, revealing carbonation by technical CO2.

Varying the applied MB dose and the differential sorption of MB by the loads resulted in a range of exposures, expressed as concentration x time cross products (CTs) that were verified by gas-chromatographic quantification of MB in chamber headspace over the course of each fumigation. CTs > or = 60 and > or = 72 mg liter(-1) h at 10.0 +/- 0.5 and 15.6 +/- 0.5 degrees C (x +/- s, average +/- SD), respectively, yielded complete mortality of approximately 6,200 larvae at each temperature. These confirmatory fumigations corroborate E. postvittana mortality data for the first time in relation to measured MB exposures and collectively comprise the largest number of larval specimens tested to date. In addition, akinetic model of MB sorption was developed for the quarantine fumigation of fresh fruit based on the measurement of exposures and how they varied across the fumigation trials.

23859722,"Adulteration of fruit juices--by the addition of sugar or other less expensive fruit juices as well as preservatives, artificial sweeteners and colours--was tested for by using a developed screening method. The method employs hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS) using electrospray ionisation in the negative mode and ultraviolet light detection. Different fruit juices can be differentiated by the content of marker compounds like sorbitol, certain phenolic molecules and their saccharide profile. This method was used to test 46 fruit juice samples from the retail market as well as 12 control samples. The study focused on the main types of fruit juices consumed on the South African market including apple, orange, grape and blends of these juices with other fruits like mango, pear and guava. Overall, the 46 samples tested mostly agreed with label claims. One grape juice sample was adulterated, probably with apple juice. Natamycin above the legal limits was found in two samples. In addition, two samples contained natamycin and one sample benzoate without it being indicated on the label. The method is well suited as a quick screening method for fruit juice adulteration and if used routinely would reduce fruit juice adulteration without the cost of the current array of tests needed for authenticity testing.","Food additives & contaminants.

The method combines the use of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography in the first dimension and a reversed phase separation in the second dimension, as well as the use of diode array and mass spectrometry detection. Using this methodology is possible to obtain in less than 50 min the complete profiling of phenolic compounds in a complex food matrix such as apple. In fact, different flavan-3-ols including procyanidin oligomers with degree of polymerization up to 8, as well as several dihydrochalcones, flavonols and a phenolic acid are separated and tentatively identified in these samples in a single run. Besides, the total phenols and total procyanidins amounts were determined using two in vitro assays. Reinette apples presented the highest content on total phenols (6.46 mg galic acid equiv./g dry matter) whereas Granny Smith apples were the richest on total procyanidins (0.73 mg epicatechin equiv./g dry matter).

23799268,"An analytical method for separation and quantitative determination of nine dithiocarbamates (DTCs) in fruits and vegetables by using LC-MS/MS was developed, validated and applied to samples purchased in local supermarkets. The nine DTCs were ziram, ferbam, thiram, maneb, zineb, nabam, metiram, mancozeb and propineb. Validation parameters of mean recovery for two matrices at two concentration levels, relative repeatability (RSDr), relative within-laboratory reproducibility (RSDR) and LOD were obtained for the nine DTCs. The results from the analysis of fruits and vegetables served as the basis for an exposure assessment within the given commodities and a risk assessment by comparing the calculated exposure to the acceptable daily intake and acute reference dose for various exposure groups. The analysis indicated positive findings of DTCs in apples, pears, plums, table grapes, papaya and broccoli at concentrations ranging from 0.03 mg/kg to 2.69 mg/kg expressed as the equivalent amount of CS2. None of the values exceeded the Maximum residue level (MRL) set by the European Union, and furthermore, it was not possible to state whether illegal use had taken place or not, because a clear differentiation between the various DTCs in the LC-MS/MS analysis was lacking.

Results obtained suggest that new antioxidant compounds were formed at the higher extraction temperatures. A desirability function response surface, considering maximum antioxidant capacity and minimal formation of brown color, was calculated and gave an optimum of 125 °C and 3 min. This latter PHWE method correlates well with the obtained results for flavonols; thus, a desirability function is a simpler alternative method for finding optimal conditions.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D000975', 'D005591', 'D002851', 'D006358', 'D007220', 'D027845', 'D010936', 'D011312', 'D014866']","['Antioxidants', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Hot Temperature', 'Industrial Waste', 'Malus', 'Plant Extracts', 'Pressure', 'Waste Products']",Extraction and neoformation of antioxidant compounds by pressurized hot water extraction from apple byproducts.,"['Q000032', 'Q000295', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'instrumentation', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23675866,2013,0,1,flavonols in dry apple product,apple,0.07142857142857142,['flavonols'],1,3
23643115,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O26 has been increasingly associated with diarrheal disease all over the world. We developed an immunochromatographic (ic) strip for the rapid detection of E. coli O26 in food samples. To determine the specificity of the IC strip, pure cultures of 67 E. coli and 22 non-E. coli strains were tested with the IC strip. The IC strip could detect all (18 of 18) E. coli O26 strains tested and did not react with strains of any other E. coli serogroup or non-E. coli strains tested (0 of 71). The minimum detection limits for E. coli O26 were 2.2 × 10(3) to 1.0 × 10(5) cfu/ml. To evaluate the ability of the IC strip to detect E. coli O26 in food, 25-g food samples (ground beef, beef liver, ground chicken, alfalfa sprout, radish sprout, spinach, natural cheese, and apple juice) were spiked with E. coli O26. The IC strip was able to detect E. coli O26 at very low levels (approximately 1 cfu/25 g of food samples) after an 18-h enrichment, and the IC strip results were in 100% agreement with the results of the culture method and pcr assay. When 115 meat samples purchased from supermarkets were tested, 5 were positive for E. coli O26 with the IC strip; these results were confirmed with a pcr assay.

The electrochemical techniques were cyclic and square wave voltammetries, and controlled potential bulk electrolysis. The number of electrons exchanged in the patulin electro-reduction of n=1 could be inferred from controlled potential bulk electrolysis measurements. Ultraviolet-visible and infrared spectroscopies were used to identify patulin electro-reduction product/s. A value of (2.1±0.1)×10(-5) cm(2) s(-1) for the patulin diffusion coefficient was calculated from convoluted cyclic voltammograms. A method based on square wave voltammetry was developed for the quantitative determination of patulin in both fresh, and commercial apple juices in the presence of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural. Calibration curves obtained from solutions of the commercial reagent, and commercial apple juices were linear in the range from 3.0×10(-7) to 2.2×10(-5) mol L(-1).

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were used to investigate the electrocatalytic behavior of CeO2- and AuSNPs/CeO2-modified SNGC electrodes, utilizing different concentrations of CeO2 nanoparticles and different AuSNPs:CeO2 w/w ratios. The best detection and quantification limits, obtained for CeO2 (10.0 mg·mL(-1))- and AuSNPs/CeO2 (3.25% w/w)-modified SNGC electrodes, were 1.59 × 10(-6) and 5.32 × 10(-6) M, and 2.93 × 10(-6) and 9.77 × 10(-6) M, respectively, with reproducibility values of 5.78% and 6.24%, respectively, for a linear concentration range from 1.5 µM to 4.0 mM of AA. The electrochemical devices were tested for the determination of AA in commercial apple juice for babies. The results were compared with those obtained by applying high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as a reference method. Recovery errors below 5% were obtained in most cases, with standard deviations lower than 3% for all the modified SNGC electrodes.

23564293,"Codling moth, Cydia pomonella L. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is a major cosmopolitan pest of apple and other pome fruits. Ethyl (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoate (pear ester) has been identified as a host-derived kairomone for female and male codling moths. However, pear ester has not performed similarly in different fruit production areas in terms of the relative magnitude of moth catch, especially the proportion of females caught. Our work was undertaken to identify host volatiles from apples, and to investigate whether these volatiles can be used to enhance the efficacy of host kairomone pear ester for monitoring female and male codling moths. Volatiles from immature apple trees were collected in the field using dynamic headspace sampling during the active period of codling moth flight. Using gas chromatography-electroantennogram detector (GC/EAD) analysis, six compounds elicited responses from antennae of females. These compounds were identified by GC/mass spectrometry (MS) and comparisons to authentic standards as nonanal, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, methyl salicylate, decanal, (Z,E)-α-farnesene, and (E,E)-α-farnesene. When the EAD-active compounds were tested individually in the field, no codling moths were caught except for a single male with decanal. However, addition of (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, methyl salicylate, decanal, or (E,E)-α-farnesene to pear ester in a binary mixture enhanced the efficacy of pear ester for attracting female codling moths compared to pear ester alone. Addition of the 6-component blend to the pear ester resulted in a significant increase in the number of males attracted, and enhanced the females captured compared to pear ester alone; the number of males and females caught was similar to that with the pear ester plus acetic acid combination lure. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to synergize the response of codling moth to host kairomone by using other host volatiles.

23544352,"How to determine trace multipesticide residues in fruits is an important problem. This paper reports a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) that was prepared using 4-(dimethoxyphosphorothioylamino)butanoic acid as the template, acrylamide as the functional monomer, and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as the cross-linker. The novel imprinted polymer was characterized by static and kinetic adsorption experiments, and it exhibited good recognition ability and fast adsorption-desorption dynamicd toward trichlorfon, malathion, acephate, methamidophos, omethoate, dimethoate, phosphamidon, monocrotophos, and methyl parathion. Using this imprinted polymer as sorbent, matrix solid-phase dispersion coupled to gas chromatography for simultaneous determination of nine trace organophosphorus pesticide residues was first presented. Under the optimized conditions, the LOD (S/N = 3) of this method for the nine organophosphorus was 0.3-1.6 μg kg(-1); the RSD for three replicate extractions ranged from 1.2 to 4.8%. The apple and pear samples spiked with nine organophosphate pesticides at levels of 20 and 100 μg kg(-1) were determined according to this method with good recoveries ranging from 81 to 105%. Moreover, this developed method was successfully applied to the quantitative detection of the nine organophosphorus pesticide residues in orange samples.

In this study, a novel basic helix-loop-helix iron-related transcription factor, IRO2, containing a 762-bp open reading frame and encoding 253 amino acids, was cloned from the iron-efficient genotype of Malus xiaojinensis. Localization analyses in onion showed that the MxIRO2 protein was targeted to the nucleus and activation studies in yeast indicated MxIRO2-BD had weak transcriptional activation activity. Prokaryotic expression of MxIRO2 in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells resulted in high expression levels of the protein when induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. The fusion protein was purified using Ni-NTA His-bind resin, and the purified MxIRO2-His fusion protein was used as the antigen to immunize a New Zealand rabbit. The resulting antiserum was purified by precipitation with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate and DEAE Sephadex A-50 chromatography to obtain the immunoglobulin G fraction. The expression of MxIRO2 in roots and leaves of M. xiaojinensis seedlings under iron deficiency was determined. The results indicated that MxIRO2 was induced in both roots and leaves under iron deficiency.

23435059,"A proteomic approach employing a two dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) technique with SYPRO Ruby, a fluorescent stain with improved sensitivity and quantitative accuracy, was performed to separate the total proteins from apple fruit at different stages of ripening and senescence. After imaging and statistical analyses were performed on 2340 spots, a total of 316 spots, or approximately 13.5% of the total protein population, was found to be significantly changed in this study. Of the 316 proteins, 219 spots were only present at a specific ripening stage, while 97 spots were significantly different (p<0.05) throughout fruit ripening and in response to ethylene treatment. From 316 candidate spots, 221 proteins were further identified by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis with protein sequence and express sequence tag (EST) data searching. Analysis and identification of proteins revealed that apple fruit ripening is associated with increase of abundance of many proteins with functions such as ethylene production, antioxidation and redox, carbohydrate metabolism, oxidative stress, energy, and defense response. Ethylene treatment increased a group of unique proteins that were not present during normal fruit ripening and have not been previously reported. It also reduced some proteins involved in primary metabolism, including those of the last few steps of the glycolytic pathway. This study demonstrated the complexity and dynamic changes of protein profiles of apple fruit during ripening and in response to exogenous ethylene treatment.

The concentration of pesticides was determined in samples derived from the different steps of processing. The processing factors (the coefficient between residue level in the processed commodity and the residue level in the commodity to be processed) obtained for the full juicing process were found to vary among the different pesticides studied. In order to investigate the relationships between the levels of pesticide residue found in apple juice samples and their physicochemical properties, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using two sets of samples (one of them using experimental data obtained in this work and the other including the data taken from the literature). In both cases the correlation was found between processing factors of pesticides in the apple juice and the negative logarithms (base 10) of the water solubility, octanol/water partition coefficient and organic carbon partition coefficient. The linear correlation between these physicochemical properties and the processing factor were established using a multiple linear regression technique.","Food additives & contaminants.

23256150,"Terpenes are specialized plant metabolites that act as attractants to pollinators and as defensive compounds against pathogens and herbivores, but they also play an important role in determining the quality of horticultural food products. We show that the genome of cultivated apple (Malus domestica) contains 55 putative terpene synthase (TPS) genes, of which only 10 are predicted to be functional. This low number of predicted functional TPS genes compared with other plant species was supported by the identification of only eight potentially functional TPS enzymes in apple 'Royal Gala' expressed sequence tag databases, including the previously characterized apple (E,E)-α-farnesene synthase. In planta functional characterization of these TPS enzymes showed that they could account for the majority of terpene volatiles produced in cv Royal Gala, including the sesquiterpenes germacrene-D and (E)-β-caryophyllene, the monoterpenes linalool and α-pinene, and the homoterpene (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene. Relative expression analysis of the TPS genes indicated that floral and vegetative tissues were the primary sites of terpene production in cv Royal Gala. However, production of cv Royal Gala floral-specific terpenes and TPS genes was observed in the fruit of some heritage apple cultivars. Our results suggest that the apple TPS gene family has been shaped by a combination of ancestral and more recent genome-wide duplication events. The relatively small number of functional enzymes suggests that the remaining terpenes produced in floral and vegetative and fruit tissues are maintained under a positive selective pressure, while the small number of terpenes found in the fruit of modern cultivars may be related to commercial breeding strategies.",Plant physiology,"['D000080462', 'D019883', 'D001483', 'D000081008', 'D035264', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D020869', 'D015971', 'D018506', 'D023281', 'D027845', 'D008969', 'D039821', 'D005810', 'D010802', 'D010940', 'D000081223', 'D020133', 'D012689', 'D012717', 'D013045', 'D013729', 'D055549', 'D014835']","['Acyclic Monoterpenes', 'Alkyl and Aryl Transferases', 'Base Sequence', 'Bicyclic Monoterpenes', 'Flowers', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Genomics', 'Malus', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monoterpenes', 'Multigene Family', 'Phylogeny', 'Plant Proteins', 'Polycyclic Sesquiterpenes', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Species Specificity', 'Terpenes', 'Volatile Organic Compounds', 'Volatilization']",Functional genomics reveals that a compact terpene synthase gene family can account for terpene volatile production in apple.,"[None, 'Q000145', None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000145', None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000145', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None]","[None, 'classification', None, None, 'genetics', 'genetics', None, None, None, None, 'methods', 'classification', None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'classification', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23256150,2013,0,1,terpene volatile,apple,0.1388888888888889,"['TPS', 'monoterpenes linalool', 'α-pinene', 'terpenes', 'terpene', 'E)-α-farnesene']",1,10

For the correct interpretation of analytical results, uncertainties of extraction and clean-up steps should be taken into account when the combined uncertainty of the analytical result is estimated. In the scope of this study, uncertainties of extraction and clean-up steps were investigated by spiking (14)C-labelled chlorpyrifos to analytical portions of tomato, orange, apple, green bean, cucumber, jackfruit, papaya and starfruit. After each step, replicate measurements were carried out with a liquid scintillation counter. Uncertainties in extraction and clean-up steps were estimated separately for every matrix and method combination by using within-laboratory reproducibility standard deviation and were characterised with the CV of recoveries. It was observed that the uncertainty of the ethyl acetate extraction step varied between 0.8% and 5.9%. The relative standard uncertainty of the clean-up step with dispersive SPE used in the method known as QuEChERS was estimated to be around 1.5% for tomato, apple and green beans. The highest variation of 4.8% was observed in cucumber.

To elucidate if the protective functions of the egg proteins of Pomacea canaliculata (Caenogastropoda, Ampullariidae), involved in embryo defenses, are present in other Pomacea species we studied scalarin (PsSC), the major perivitellin of Pomacea scalaris. Using small angle X-ray scattering, fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy and biochemical methods, we analyzed PsSC structural stability, agglutinating activity, sugar specificity and protease resistance. PsSC aggluttinated rabbit, and, to a lesser extent, human B and A erythrocytes independently of divalent metals Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) were strongly inhibited by galactosamine and glucosamine. The protein was structurally stable between pH 2.0 to 10.0, though agglutination occurred only between pH 4.0 to 8.0 (maximum activity at pH 7.0). The agglutinating activity was conserved up to 60 °C and completely lost above 80 °C, in agreement with the structural thermal stability of the protein (up to 60 °C).

23182936,"Gas and liquid chromatography (GC and LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) serve as the most powerful analytical tools commonly used to monitor pesticide residues in food, among other applications. However, both GC-MS and LC-MS are susceptible to matrix effects which can adversely affect quantification depending on the analyte, matrix, sample preparation, instrumentation, and operating conditions. Among the approaches that reduce matrix effects, the most common in pesticide residue applications is matrix-matched calibration because it is relatively inexpensive and simple. Also, it has been shown to work well during method validation when fortified samples are exactly matched with samples used for calibration. However, the quality of matrix-matched results in real-world analyses depends on the consistency of matrix effects among diverse samples. In this study, the variability of matrix effects was measured for 38 representative pesticides in 20 samples each (including different varieties) of rice, orange, apple, and spinach extracted using the ""quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe"" (QuEChERS) method for analysis by LC-MS/MS and low-pressure GC-MS. Using LC-MS/MS, only oranges gave >20% matrix effects for a few pesticides. GC-MS exhibited larger matrix effects, but as in LC-MS/MS, the differences were reasonably consistent among the 20 samples tested. Main conclusions of this study are that for the conditions utilized: (1) matrix-matching was not needed for most pesticides in the simpler food matrices; and (2) for the more complex orange matrix, acceptably accurate quantitative results were achieved by using matrix-matching even with a different sample of the same type. However, full confidence cannot be extended to matrix-matched results, and for consequential applications such as regulatory enforcement, confirmatory analyses using alternate quantitative determinations should also be conducted.",Journal of chromatography.

23147821,"Condensed tannins take an important part in the sensory quality of food and beverage. Sensory analyses are usually carried out with various tannin fractions isolated from food or beverage, and their interpretation are limited by the lack of knowledge in the fine and accurate molecular composition of the tannin fractions. Besides, the studies of the chemical reactivity conducted in model solutions with 'simple' flavanols allow a better understanding of their evolution pathways, but they cannot take into account their reactivity as polymers, specifically regarding oxidation. In particular, competition between intramolecular and intermolecular reactions may strongly impact on the tannin structures (size, branching and conformation) and consequently on their properties. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry electrospray ionization mass spectrometer analytical method was thus developed in order to identify oxidized tannins generated by autoxidation. Given the difficulties to separate and detect tannins with high DP, samples were depolymerized by chemical depolymerization prior to analysis. Since the linkages created by oxidation are not cleavable in the usual depolymerization conditions (contrarily to the original interflavanic linkages), specific oxidation residues are released from tannins structures after their autoxidation. Oxidation markers of both intermolecular and intramolecular mechanisms have been identified; these are mainly dimers and trimers, more or less oxidized, and some contain additional hydroxyl groups. Furthermore, the nature of the subunits (extension vs terminal) making up these dimers and trimers was clearly established.",Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS,"['D015415', 'D002851', 'D005504', 'D027845', 'D008958', 'D010084', 'D058105', 'D021241', 'D013634']","['Biomarkers', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Food Analysis', 'Malus', 'Models, Molecular', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Polymerization', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Tannins']",UPLC-ESI-MS study of the oxidation markers released from tannin depolymerization: toward a better characterization of the tannin evolution over food and beverage processing.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000379', 'Q000032']","['analysis', 'methods', 'methods', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'methods', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23147821,2013,0,0,tannins,apple,0.11428571428571428,"['tannins', 'flavanols', 'tannin', 'hydroxyl']",1,8

In apple (Malus × domestica), an R2R3 MYB transcription factor has been shown to control fruit flesh and foliage anthocyanin pigmentation (MYB10) and fruit skin color (MYB1). However, the pattern of expression and allelic variation at these loci does not explain all anthocyanin-related apple phenotypes. One such example is an open-pollinated seedling of cv Sangrado that has green foliage and develops red flesh in the fruit cortex late in maturity. We used methods that combine plant breeding, molecular biology, and genomics to identify duplicated MYB transcription factors that could control this phenotype. We then demonstrated that the red-flesh cortex phenotype is associated with enhanced expression of MYB110a, a paralog of MYB10. Functional characterization of MYB110a showed that it was able to up-regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). The chromosomal location of MYB110a is consistent with a whole-genome duplication event that occurred during the evolution of apple within the Maloideae family.

23077632,"Fibrillin4 (FBN4) is a protein component of plastoglobules, which are antioxidant-rich sub-compartments attached to the chloroplast thylakoid membranes. FBN4 is required for normal plant biotic and abiotic stress resistance, including bacterial pathogens, herbicide, high light intensity, and ozone; FBN4 is also required for the accumulation of osmiophilic material inside plastoglobules. In this study, the contribution of FBN4 to plastoglobule lipid composition was examined using cultivated apple trees in which FBN4 gene expression was knocked down using RNA interference. Chloroplasts and plastoglobules were isolated from leaves of wild-type and fbn4 knock-down trees. Total lipids were extracted from chloroplasts and plastoglobules separately, and analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Three lipids were consistently present at lower levels in the plastoglobules from fbn4 knock-down apple leaves compared to the wild-type as determined by LC-MS multiple ion monitoring. One of these species had a molecular mass and fragmentation pattern that identified it as plastoquinone, a known major component of plastoglobules. The plastoquinone level in fbn4 knock-down plastoglobules was less than 10% of that in wild-type plastoglobules. In contrast, plastoquinone was present at similar levels in the lipid extracts of whole chloroplasts from leaves of wild-type and fbn4 knock-down trees. These results suggest that the partitioning of plastoquinone between the plastoglobules and the rest of the chloroplast is disrupted in fbn4 knock-down leaves. These results indicate that FBN4 is required for high-level accumulation of plastoquinone and some other lipids in the plastoglobule. The dramatic decrease in plastoquinone content in fbn4 knock-down plastoglobules is consistent with the decreased plastoglobule osmiophilicity previously described for fbn4 knock-down plastoglobules.

Considering that a selective and sensitive method has been developed for the determination of multiclass pesticide residues in different commodities by GC-MS with a triple stage quadrupole analyzer (GC-TSQ-MS); the pesticide signal has been optimized in MS-MS whilst working in negative chemical ionization mode using methane as the reagent gas. The proposed method was fully validated for 53 compounds in tomato, apple and orange matrices. The obtained limits of determination were lower than 0.1 μg/kg for more than 50% of the pesticides studied, and lower than 1 μg/kg for all pesticides studied, except for cypermethrin, boscalid, bifenthrin and deltamethrin. Linearity was studied in the 0.5-50 μg/kg range and a linear response was obtained for all pesticides in all matrices. Recoveries were evaluated at two different levels (1 and 50 μg/kg) and recoveries were ranged between 70 and 120% in tomato, apple and orange, except in the cases of chlorfenapyr, ofurace, chlozolinate, chlorothalonil, tolylfluanid and dichlofluanid with recovery values close to 60% at 1 μg/kg fortification levels. Repetitivity was evaluated and the relative standard deviation (RSD%) was lower than 10% in all cases. The developed method was employed in the analysis of real samples intended for baby food and the obtained results showed that 50% of the samples were positive for different pesticide residues. The concentration range detected was between 5 and 100 μg/kg. The positive detection of OCs was particularly noticeable; these included chlorothalonil, fenhexamide, clorpyrifos and lambda cyhalothrin, which are very persistent and toxic with low acute reference dose. Endosulfan sulfate, which is not approved, was detected at a low concentration.",Journal of chromatography.

23057586,"Flavor release from 6 commercial apple cultivars (Fuji, Granny Smith, Golden Delicious, Jonagold, Morgen Dallago, and Red Delicious) under static conditions (intact or fresh-cut samples) and during consumption of fresh-cut samples (nosespace) was determined by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry. Textural (firmness, fracturability, flesh elasticity, and rupture) and physicochemical (pH, acidity, and water content) properties of the apples were also measured. Static headspace analysis of intact fruits revealed Fuji and Granny Smith apples had the lowest concentration for all measured flavor compounds (esters, aldehydes, alcohols, and terpenes), whereas Red Delicious apples had the highest. Fresh-cut samples generally showed a significant increase in total volatile compounds with acetaldehyde being most abundant. However, compared to intact fruits, cut Golden and Red Delicious apples had a lower intensity for ester related peaks. Five parameters were extracted from the nosespace data of peaks related to esters (m/z 43, 61), acetaldehyde (m/z 45), and ethanol (m/z 47): 2 associated with mastication (duration of mastication-t(con); time required for first swallowing event-t(swal)), and 3 related with in-nose volatile compound concentration (area under the curve-AUC; maximum intensity-I(max); time for achieving I(max)-t(max)). Three different behaviors were identified in the nosespace data: a) firm samples with low AUC and t(swal) values (Granny Smith, Fuji), b) mealy samples with high AUC, I(max), t(swal) values, and low t(con) (Morgen Dallago, Golden Delicious), and c) firm samples with high AUC and I(max) values (Red Delicious).

23010246,"This study addresses a current trend in chemical food safety control represented by an effort to integrate analyses of various groups of food contaminants/toxicants into a single, high-throughput method. The choice of optimal sample preparation step is one of the key conditions to achieve good performance characteristics. In this context, we investigated the possibility to expand the scope of the three multi-analyte extraction procedures employed earlier in other studies for rapid isolation of either pesticides or mycotoxins from plant matrices. Following procedures were tested: A - aqueous acetonitrile extraction followed by partition (QuEChERS-like method), B - aqueous acetonitrile extraction, and C - pure acetonitrile extraction. On the list of target analytes, we had 288 pesticides (including 'troublesome' acidic, basic and base-sensitive compounds) together with 38 mycotoxins (including all EU regulated ones and many 'emerging' toxins on the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) list). The matrices selected for the experiments, apple baby food, wheat flour, spices and sunflower seeds, represented various composition categories in terms of moisture, fat and extractable compounds (e.g. pigments and essential oils) content. In preliminary experiments, acceptable recoveries (70-120%) for most of analytes were obtained by the analysis of spiked matrices, regardless which extraction procedure was used. However, when analysing dry samples with incurred pesticide residues/mycotoxins, the method C did not enable efficient extraction of some common contaminants. Procedure A, thanks to a higher matrix equivalent compared to the method B and relatively less pronounced matrix effects, enabled lower quantification limits for all analyte/matrix combinations, with the exception of polar mycotoxins and/or pesticides. Higher recoveries for the latter group of analytes could be achieved by the method B; on the other hand, extraction efficiency of non-polar pesticides from fatty matrix was rather poor by this method.",Journal of chromatography.

In this study, we elucidate the pathway by which 6-propylbenzofuran-7-ol formed. Isotope labeling studies revealed that the propyl group of 6-propylbenzofuran-7-ol derives from (E)-hex-2-enal and that 6-propylbenzofuran-7-ol contains carbons 2-6 of ascorbic acid. Two compounds, namely, 2,3-dihydro-6-propylbenzofuran-3,7-diol and 3-(2-furoyl)hexanal, were identified as byproducts of a model reaction of ascorbic acid and (E)-hex-2-enal. Each of these compounds was dissolved in an aqueous solution of citric acid and stored at 60 °C for 1 week. After storage, 6-propylbenzofuran-7-ol was detected from a solution of 2,3-dihydro-6-propylbenzofuran-3,7-diol, but not from 3-(2-furoyl)hexanal. 6-Propylbenzofuran-7-ol was formed by isolating tricyclic hemiacetal lactone derived from the Michael addition of ascorbic acid to (E)-hex-2-enal, mixing the tricyclic hemiacetal lactone with the aqueous solution of citric acid, and applying heat.

22959847,"The capabilities of a recently launched atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) source for mass spectrometry (MS) coupled to gas chromatography (GC) have been tested in order to evaluate its potential in pesticide residue analysis in fruits and vegetables. Twenty-five pesticides were selected due to their high fragmentation under electron ionization (EI), making that the molecular ion (M+) is practically absent in their spectra. The fragmentation of these pesticides under APCI conditions was studied, with the result that M+ was not only present but also highly abundant for most compounds, with noticeable differences in the fragmentation patterns in comparison with EI. Moreover, the addition of water as modifier was tested to promote the formation of protonated molecules ([M+H]+). Under these conditions, [M+H]+ became the base peak of the spectrum for the majority of compounds, thus leading to an increase of sensitivity in the subsequent GC-MS/MS method developed using triple quadrupole analyzer (QqQ). Highly satisfactory sensitivity and precision, in terms of repeatability, were reached and linearity was satisfactory in the range 0.01-100 ng/mL. The developed methodology was applied to apple, orange, tomato and carrot QuEChERS fortified extracts in order to evaluate the matrix effects. In summary, the soft and reproducible ionization in the APCI source has greatly favored the formation of [M+H]+ oppositely to EI where abundant fragmentation occurs and where the molecular ions have low abundance or are even absent in the mass spectrum. In this way, the use of APCI has facilitated the development of tandem MS methods based on the selection of abundant [M+H]+ as precursor ion.",Journal of chromatography.

22946800,"Standing variation can be critical for speciation. Here, we investigate the origins of fruit odor discrimination for Rhagoletis pomonella underlying the fly's sympatric shift in the northeastern United States from downy hawthorn (Crataegus mollis) to apple (Malus domestica). Because R. pomonella mate on host fruit, preferences for natal fruit volatiles generate prezygotic isolation. Apples emit volatiles that appear to be missing from gas chromatography/electroantennographic detection profiles for flies infesting downy hawthorns, raising the question of how R. pomonella evolved a preference for apple. In the southern United States, R. pomonella attacks several native hawthorns. Behaviorally active volatile blends for R. pomonella infesting southern hawthorns contain the missing apple volatiles, potentially explaining why downy hawthorn flies could have evolved to be sensitive to a blend of apple volatiles. Flight tunnel assays imply that southern hawthorn populations were not the antecedent of a preassembled apple race, as southern flies were not attracted to the apple volatile blend. Instead, behavioral evidence was found for southern host races on native hawthorns, complementing the story of the historical sympatric shift to introduced apple in the North and illustrating how R. pomonella may evolve novel combinations of agonist and antagonist responses to volatiles to use new fruit resources.",Evolution; international journal of organic evolution,"['D000818', 'D001522', 'D027825', 'D049810', 'D058507', 'D027845', 'D009812', 'D033621', 'D055549']","['Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Crataegus', 'Genetic Speciation', 'Host Specificity', 'Malus', 'Odorants', 'Tephritidae', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",On the scent of standing variation for speciation: behavioral evidence for native sympatric host races of Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae) in the southern United States.,"[None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000502', 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'physiology', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22946800,2013,0,0,speciation of flies,apple,0.0,[],1,0

22867437,"An ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography accurate mass quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization (UHPLC-(ESI)QTOF MS/MS) method was developed for measuring individual quercetin metabolites in human plasma with high sensitivity and high selectivity. Quercetin (3,3',4',5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) occurs as glycosides in foods. The composition of glycosides is species and cultivar specific. In humans, quercetin undergoes extensive biotransformation, resulting in a range of metabolites. The bioactivity of quercetin metabolites will depend on the type and position of the conjugates. Herein, individual quercetin metabolites (i.e., sulfate, glucuronide or methyl conjugates) were identified by accurate mass MS in human plasma (females = 8 and males = 8) over 24 h after consumption of applesauce enriched with either micronized apple peel (AP) or onion powder (OP). The AP and OP contained ~180 μmol of quercetin glycosides. The relative amounts of quercetin metabolites were quantified in plasma. The complement of identified quercetin metabolites was similar after consumption of AP and OP. Primary metabolites included the following: quercetin sulfate, quercetin glucuronide, and quercetin diglucuronide. A quercetin glutathione adduct was identified in negative ion mode but not apparent in positive ion mode.

Response surface methodology was used to investigate the effects of processing parameters, including ultrasound power, extraction time, temperature, and ethanol concentration on total polyphenols yield and polyphenols composition was analyzed by HPLC. Antioxidant activity of the polyphenols was evaluated as 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydracyl scavenging activity and inhibition activity of lipid peroxidation. The results showed that 10-100 times higher total polyphenols yield was obtained from the unripe apple than those from the reported apple pomace. The optimum extraction conditions were ultrasonic power of 519.39 W, extraction time of 30 min, extraction temperature 50°C, ethanol concentration of 50% gave the total polyphenols yield of 13.26 ± 0.56 mg GAE/g. HPLC analysis indicated that (-)-epicatechin, procyanidin B2, chlorogenic acid, and procyanidin B1 were the predominant polyphenols in unripe apple, which contributed to the higher antioxidant activity to 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydracyl of unripe apple polyphenols than other apple polyphenols.

22797850,"The larva of codling moth Cydia pomonella (Tortricidae, Lepidoptera) is known as the worm in the apple, mining the fruit for food. We here show that codling moth larvae are closely associated with yeasts of the genus Metschnikowia. Yeast is an essential part of the larval diet and further promotes larval survival by reducing the incidence of fungal infestations in the apple. Larval feeding, on the other hand, enables yeast proliferation on unripe fruit. Chemical, physiological and behavioral analyses demonstrate that codling moth senses and responds to yeast aroma. Female moths are attracted to fermenting yeast and lay more eggs on yeast-inoculated than on yeast-free apples. An olfactory response to yeast volatiles strongly suggests a contributing role of yeast in host finding, in addition to plant volatiles. Codling moth is a widely studied insect of worldwide economic importance, and it is noteworthy that its association with yeasts has gone unnoticed. Tripartite relationships between moths, plants, and microorganisms may, accordingly, be more widespread than previously thought. It, therefore, is important to study the impact of microorganisms on host plant ecology and their contribution to the signals that mediate host plant finding and recognition.

First, cashew apple juice supplementation for optimal production of biosurfactant by B. subtilis LAMI005 was studied. The medium formulated with clarified cashew apple juice and distilled water, supplemented with 1.0 g/L of (NH(4))(2)SO(4), proved to be the best among the nutrients evaluated. The crude biosurfactant had the ability to decrease the surface tension of water to 30 dyne/cm, with a critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 63.0 mg/L. Emulsification experiments indicated that this biosurfactant effectively emulsified kerosene (IE(24)=67%) and soybean oil (IE(24)=64%). Furthermore, the emulsion stability was always very high.

22771060,"Metabolomics currently represents one of the fastest growing high-throughput molecular analysis platforms that refer to the simultaneous and unbiased analysis of metabolite pools constituting a particular biological system under investigation. In response to the ever increasing interest in development of reliable methods competent with obtaining a complete and accurate metabolomic snapshot for subsequent identification, quantification and profiling studies, the purpose of the current investigation is to test the feasibility of solid phase microextraction for advanced fingerprinting of volatile and semivolatile metabolites in complex samples. In particular, the current study is focussed on the development and optimization of solid phase microextraction (SPME) - comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-ToFMS) methodology for metabolite profiling of apples (Malus × domestica Borkh.). For the first time, GC × GC attributes in terms of molecular structure-retention relationships and utilization of two-dimensional separation space on orthogonal GC × GC setup were exploited in the field of SPME method optimization for complex sample analysis. Analytical performance data were assessed in terms of method precision when commercial coatings are employed in spiked metabolite aqueous sample analysis. The optimized method consisted of the implementation of direct immersion SPME (DI-SPME) extraction mode and its application to metabolite profiling of apples, and resulted in a tentative identification of 399 metabolites and the composition of a metabolite database far more comprehensive than those obtainable with classical one-dimensional GC approaches. Considering that specific metabolome constituents were for the first time reported in the current study, a valuable approach for future advanced fingerprinting studies in the field of fruit biology is proposed. The current study also intensifies the understanding of SPME-GC×GC-ToFMS hyphenation and outlines the benefits of facilitating GC×GC for SPME method optimization. The obtained results clearly illustrate that acquisition of a more complete metabolome snapshot is only attainable under optimized conditions for both techniques.",Journal of chromatography.

22769008,"Diaquacobinamide (H(2)O)(2)Cbi(2+) or its conjugate base hydroxyaquacobinamide (OH(H(2)O)Cbi(+))) can bind up to two cyanide ions, making dicyanocobinamide. This transition is accompanied by a significant change in color, previously exploited for cyanide determination. The reagent OH(H(2)O)Cbi(+) is used in excess; when trace amounts of cyanide are added, CN(H(2)O)Cbi(+) should be formed. But the spectral absorption of CN(H(2)O)Cbi(+) is virtually the same as that of OH(H(2)O)Cbi(+). It has been inexplicable how trace amounts of cyanide are sensitively measured by this reaction. It is shown here that even with excess OH(H(2)O)Cbi(+), (CN)(2)Cbi is formed first due to kinetic reasons; this only slowly forms CN(H(2)O)Cbi(+). This understanding implies that CN(H(2)O)Cbi(+) will itself be a better reagent. We describe a single valve merging zone flow analyzer that allows both sample and reagent economy.

22760506,"The chain-length compatibility of mixed anionic-cationic surfactants was investigated for the extraction of organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs). Cationic surfactants with different chain lengths (n = 12 and 16) were mixed with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; n = 12) for the mixed anionic-cationic surfactants-based extraction. Six OPPs were studied including azinphos-methyl, parathion-methyl, fenitrothion, diazinon, chlorpyrifos, and prothiophos. Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography was used for the determination of the studied OPPs. The extraction was performed using mixtures of SDS and cationic surfactants including dodecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide or dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB; n = 12) and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide or cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB; n = 16). The parameters affecting the extraction efficiencies of two extraction systems were studied and discussed. The optimum condition for SDS-DTAB was 15 mmol L(-1) SDS and 1 mmol L(-1) DTAB in the presence of 15% (w/v) sodium chloride (NaCl). Meanwhile, the condition for SDS-CTAB was 10 mmol L(-1) SDS and 1.0 mmol L(-1) CTAB with 10% (w/v) NaCl. Under the optimum conditions, the extraction efficiency of SDS-DTAB (66-85%) was slightly higher than that of SDS-CTAB (61-82%). In addition, the SDS-DTAB system also gave greater enrichment factor than SDS-CTAB for all the studied OPPs. This result may be due to the compatibility of chain length between SDS and DTAB. The extraction using SDS-DTAB was successfully applied to determine OPPs in fruit samples (i.e., pomelo, apple, and pineapple). No contamination by the studied OPPs in samples was observed. Good accuracy with recoveries ranging from 77 to 105% was obtained.

22733236,"Fruit firmness constitutes an important textural property and is one of the key parameters for estimating ripening and shelf life, which has a major impact on commercialization. In order to decipher the mechanisms related to firmness of apples (Malus × domestica Borkh.), two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to compare the total proteome of high and low firmness phenotypes from apple hypanthia of a 'Golden Delicious' × 'Dietrich' population. A total of 36 differentially regulated protein spots were positively identified by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and then validated against the Malus expressed sequence tags (EST) database. The findings of this study indicated a lower expression of ethylene biosynthesis related proteins in the high firmness phenotype, which could be linked to the slowing down of the ripening and softening processes. The reduced accumulation of proteins involved in ethylene biosynthesis juxtaposed to the upregulation of a transposase and a GTP-binding protein in the high firmness phenotype. The results also showed higher expression of cytoskeleton proteins in the high firmness phenotype compared to the low firmness phenotype, which play a role in maintaining cell structure and possibly fruit integrity.

22717407,"Carotenoid accumulation confers distinct colouration to plant tissues, with effects on plant response to light and as well as health benefits for consumers of plant products. The carotenoid pathway is controlled by flux of metabolites, rate-limiting enzyme steps, feed-back inhibition, and the strength of sink organelles, the plastids, in the cell. In apple (Malus × domestica Borkh), fruit carotenoid concentrations are low in comparison with those in other fruit species. The apple fruit flesh, in particular, begins development with high amounts of chlorophylls and carotenoids, but in all commercial cultivars a large proportion of this is lost by fruit maturity. To understand the control of carotenoid concentrations in apple fruit, metabolic and gene expression analysis of the carotenoid pathway were measured in genotypes with varying flesh and skin colour. Considerable variation in both carotenoid concentrations and compound profile was observed between tissues and genotypes, with carotenes and xanthophylls being found only in fruit accumulating high carotenoid concentrations.

22715692,"A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method was developed for the determination of 40 pesticides in fruits. The effects of adding analyte protectants were evaluated for compensating matrix effects and the impacts on the quantitative results. A new combination of analyte protectants - Polyethylene Glycol 400 (PEG 400) and olive oil combination, which can be dissolved in acetone, was used for the quantitative analysis. The pesticides were extracted from fruit samples with acetonitrile and the extracts were cleaned up using micro-solid phase extraction. A GC-MS method in selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode coupled with large volume injection was finally developed. Using the newly developed analyte protectant combination of PEG 400 and olive oil, a good linearity was obtained in the range of 1 - 200 microg/L with coefficients better than 0.99, and the detection limits were between 0.1 - 3.0 microg/L. The mean recoveries of the pesticides were 75% - 119% with the relative standard deviation values less than 16.6% except for dimethoate. The performance of the analyte protectants was compared with matrix-matched standards calibration curves in terms of quantitative accuracy. The results showed that the method of adding analyte protectants can replace the matrix-matched standard calibration, and can also reduce the sample pretreatment. When the devel- oped method was used for the analysis of apple, peache, orange, banana, grape and other fruit samples, a good matrix compensation effect was achieved, and thus effectively reduced the bad effects of the water-soluble agents to the gas chromatographic column.",Se pu = Chinese journal of chromatography,"['D005506', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D000069463', 'D010573', 'D010938', 'D011092']","['Food Contamination', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Olive Oil', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Plant Oils', 'Polyethylene Glycols']",[Rapid determination of 40 pesticide residues in fruits using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with analyte protectants to compensate for matrix effects].,"['Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737']","['analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22715692,2014,0,0,pesticide residues,apple,0.12857142857142856,"['40 pesticides', 'pesticides', 'PEG 400', 'dimethoate', 'microg/L.', 'acetonitrile', 'analyte protectants - Polyethylene Glycol 400', 'acetone']",1,9

22628198,"The freezing pattern and frost killing temperatures of apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) xylem were determined by differential thermal analysis and infrared differential thermal analysis (IDTA). Results from detached or attached twigs in controlled freezing experiments and during natural field freezing of trees were compared. Non-lethal freezing of apoplastic water in apple xylem as monitored during natural winter frosts in the field occurred at -1.9 ± 0.4 °C and did not change seasonally. The pattern of whole tree freezing was variable and specific to the environmental conditions. On detached twigs high-temperature freezing exotherms (HTEs) occurred 2.8 K below the temperature observed under natural frosts in the field with a seasonal mean of -4.7 ± 0.5 °C. Microporous apple xylem showed freezing without a specific pattern within a few seconds in IDTA images during HTEs, which is in contrast to macroporous xylem where a 2D freezing pattern mirrors anatomical structures. The pith tissue always remained unfrozen. Increasing twig length increased ice nucleation temperature; for increased twig diameter the effect was not significant. In attached twigs frozen in field portable freezing chambers, HTEs were recorded at a similar mean temperature (-4.6 ± 1.0 °C) to those for detached twigs. Upon lethal intracellular freezing of apple xylem parenchyma cells (XPCs) low-temperature freezing exotherms (LTEs) can be recorded. Low-temperature freezing exotherms determined on detached twigs varied significantly between a winter minimum of -36.9 °C and a summer maximum -12.7 °C. Within the temperature range wherein LTEs were recorded by IDTA in summer (-12.7 ± 0.5 to -20.3 ± 1.1 °C) various tiny clearly separated discontinuous freezing events could be detected similar to that in other species with contrasting XPC anatomy. These freezing events appeared to be initially located in the primary and only later in the secondary xylem. During the LTE no freezing events in the bark and central pith tissue were recorded. Attached twigs were exposed to various freezing temperatures at which LTEs occur.

22608453,"The advantages and shortcomings of focused microwave-induced combustion (FMIC) for digestion of plant samples were studied. The effects of sample mass, absorbing solution, oxygen gas flow-rate, and time of reflux step on recoveries of major, minor and trace metals were systematically evaluated. Afterwards, Al, Ba, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Mg, Mn, Ni, Sr, V, and Zn were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) and by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The main advantages of FMIC when compared to microwave-assisted wet digestion (MAWD) and focused-microwave-assisted wet digestion (FMAWD) are the possibility to digest larger masses of samples (up to 3g) using shorter heating times and diluted nitric acid solution for absorbing all analytes. Using the selected experimental conditions for FMIC, residual carbon content was lower than 0.7% for all samples and relative standard deviation (RSD) varied from 1.5 to 14.1%. Certified reference materials (NIST 1515 apple leaves and NIST 1547 peach leaves) were used for checking accuracy and determined values for all metals were in agreement with certified values at a 95% confidence level. No statistical difference (ANOVA, 95% of confidence level) was observed for results obtained by FMIC, FMAWD, and MAWD. Limits of detection were lower when using FMIC in the range of 0.02-0.15 μg g(-1) for ICP OES and 0.001-0.01 μg g(-1) for ICP-MS, which were about 3 and 6 times lower than the values obtained by FMAWD and MAWD, respectively. It is important to point out that FMIC was a suitable sample preparation method for major, minor and trace metals by both determination techniques (ICP OES and ICP-MS). Additionally, since it allows lower LODs (because up to 3g of sample can be digested) and diluted acid solutions are used (without any further dilution), the use of ICP-MS is not mandatory.",Talanta,"['D002244', 'D006358', 'D057230', 'D013058', 'D008670', 'D008872', 'D017942', 'D010100', 'D010944', 'D013054']","['Carbon', 'Hot Temperature', 'Limit of Detection', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metals', 'Microwaves', 'Nitric Acid', 'Oxygen', 'Plants', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic']",Focused microwave-induced combustion for digestion of botanical samples and metals determination by ICP OES and ICP-MS.,"['Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000032', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None]","['chemistry', None, None, None, 'analysis', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22608453,2012,0,0,Apple leaves as reference,apple,0.1134020618556701,"['Cu', 'carbon', 'oxygen', 'Sr', 'Zn', 'Mn', 'nitric acid', 'Ca', 'Ni', 'flow-rate', 'Mg']",1,11

22504369,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) are the most potent toxins known. Produced by Clostridium botulinum, BoNTs are classified into seven, antigenically distinct serotypes, designated A-G. The toxin acts to inhibit acetylcholine release, resulting in paralysis and death. Naturally occurring foodborne disease is most often the result of improper canning of foods, while wound botulism, associated with injection drug users, is on the rise. Because of its potency, BoNTs have also been identified as targets for use by bioterrorists. The 'gold standard' of detection of BoNTs is the mouse bioassay, an expensive and time consuming test that requires specialized equipment and trained personnel. There is a need for a rapid, sensitive diagnostic for BoNTs that could be used by minimally trained personnel in the event of a foodborne outbreak or a bioterrorist threat. Here, we describe the use of a single lateral flow device (LFD) that can detect and distinguish between BoNT/A and B, two of the four serotypes that are known to intoxicate humans and together represent >80% of naturally occurring illness. The device could detect as little as 5 ng/mL of purified BoNT/A and 10 ng/mL of BoNT/B in 2% and 1% milk, respectively. In undiluted apple juice, 25 ng/mL of BoNT/A and 10 ng/mL of BoNT/B could be detected. No cross reactivity between BoNT/A and B antibodies was observed. The LFD described here is easy to use, requires no specialized training or equipment, and can identify and distinguish between BoNT/A and /B serotypes.

22491160,"Numerous and diverse physiological changes occur during fruit ripening, including the development of a specific volatile blend that characterizes fruit aroma. Maturity at harvest is one of the key factors influencing the flavor quality of fruits and vegetables. The validation of robust methods that rapidly assess fruit maturity and aroma quality would allow improved management of advanced breeding programs, production practices and postharvest handling. Over the last three decades, much research has been conducted to develop so-called electronic noses, which are devices able to rapidly detect odors and flavors. Currently there are several commercially available electronic noses able to perform volatile analysis, based on different technologies. The electronic nose used in our work (zNose, EST, Newbury Park, CA, USA), consists of ultra-fast gas chromatography coupled with a surface acoustic wave sensor (UFGC-SAW). This technology has already been tested for its ability to monitor quality of various commodities, including detection of deterioration in apple; ripeness and rot evaluation in mango; aroma profiling of thymus species; C(6) volatile compounds in grape berries; characterization of vegetable oil and detection of adulterants in virgin coconut oil. This system can perform the three major steps of aroma analysis: headspace sampling, separation of volatile compounds, and detection. In about one minute, the output, a chromatogram, is produced and, after a purging cycle, the instrument is ready for further analysis. The results obtained with the zNose can be compared to those of other gas-chromatographic systems by calculation of Kovats Indices (KI). Once the instrument has been tuned with an alkane standard solution, the retention times are automatically converted into KIs. However, slight changes in temperature and flow rate are expected to occur over time, causing retention times to drift. Also, depending on the polarity of the column stationary phase, the reproducibility of KI calculations can vary by several index units. A series of programs and graphical interfaces were therefore developed to compare calculated KIs among samples in a semi-automated fashion. These programs reduce the time required for chromatogram analysis of large data sets and minimize the potential for misinterpretation of the data when chromatograms are not perfectly aligned. We present a method for rapid volatile compound analysis in fruit. Sample preparation, data acquisition and handling procedures are also discussed.",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,"['D002849', 'D005638', 'D055549', 'D014835']","['Chromatography, Gas', 'Fruit', 'Volatile Organic Compounds', 'Volatilization']",Fruit volatile analysis using an electronic nose.,"['Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', None]","['methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22491160,2012,0,1,volatiles in apple,apple,0.047619047619047616,"['KI', 'grape berries', 'Kovats', 'C(6', 'headspace', 'chromatogram']",1,6

22399441,"The apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, infests apple (Malus domestica) and hawthorn species (most notably the downy hawthorn, Crataegus mollis) in the eastern USA. Evidence suggests that the fly was introduced into the western USA sometime in the last 60 years. In addition to apple, R. pomonella also infests two species of hawthorns in the western USA as major hosts: the native black hawthorn (C. douglasii) and the introduced ornamental English hawthorn, C. monogyna. Apple and downy hawthorn-origin flies in the eastern USA use volatile blends emitted from the surface of their respective ripening fruit to find and discriminate among host trees. To test whether the same is true for western flies, we used coupled gas chromatography and electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) and developed a 7-component apple fruit blend for western apple-origin flies, an 8-component black hawthorn fruit blend for flies infesting C. douglasii, and a 9-component ornamental hawthorn blend for flies from C. monogyna. Crataegus douglasii and C. monogyna-origin flies showed similar levels of upwind directed flight to their respective natal synthetic fruit blends in flight tunnel assays compared to whole fruit adsorbent extracts, indicating that the blends contain all the behaviorally relevant fruit volatiles to induce maximal response levels. The black and ornamental hawthorn blends shared four compounds in common including 3-methylbutan-1-ol, which appears to be a key volatile for R. pomonella populations in the eastern, southern, and western USA that show a preference for fruit from different Crataegus species.

High-temperature treatment used to prepare well-done meats increases the formation of carcinogenic heterocyclic amines (HCAs). We evaluated the ability of plant extracts, spices, and essential oils to simultaneously inactivate  E. coli  O157:H7 and suppress HCA formation in heated hamburger patties. Ground beef with added antimicrobials was inoculated with  E. coli  O157:H7 (10(7) CFU/g). Patties were cooked to reach 45 °C at the geometric center, flipped, and cooked for 5 min. Samples were then taken for microbiological and mass spectrometry analysis of HCAs. Some compounds were inhibitory only against  E. coli  or HCA formation, while some others inhibited both. Addition of 5% olive or apple skin extracts reduced  E. coli  O157:H7 populations to below the detection limit and by 1.6 log CFU/g, respectively. Similarly, 1% lemongrass oil reduced  E. coli  O157:H7 to below detection limits, while clove bud oil reduced the pathogen by 1.6 log CFU/g.

Untargeted metabolic profiling of peel and flesh tissues of ripe fruits was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), resulting in the detection of 418 metabolites in peel and 254 in flesh. In mQTL mapping using MetaNetwork, 669 significant mQTLs were detected: 488 in the peel and 181 in the flesh. Four linkage groups (LGs), LG1, LG8, LG13, and LG16, were found to contain mQTL hotspots, mainly regulating metabolites that belong to the phenylpropanoid pathway. The genetics of annotated metabolites was studied in more detail using MapQTL®. A number of quercetin conjugates had mQTLs on LG1 or LG13. The most important mQTL hotspot with the largest number of metabolites was detected on LG16: mQTLs for 33 peel-related and 17 flesh-related phenolic compounds. Structural genes involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway were located, using the apple genome sequence.

The chelator- and carbonate-extracts always had the analytical characteristics of pectins, with high proportions of uronic acids, arabinose and galactose as the main monosaccharides, and a significant proportion of rhamnose, but the cross-linking glycan fractions were still rich in RG-I-like material. The application of PGRs produced shifts of uronic acid and neutral sugars between fractions. Arabinose was the neutral sugar exhibiting more variations in apple callus cell wall. Picloram and abscisic acid produced an increase of the uronic acid contents of the cell walls.

22270558,"cDNA-AFLP analysis for transcript profiling has been successfully applied to study many plant biological systems, particularly plant-microbe interactions. However, the separation of cDNA-AFLP fragments by gel electrophoresis is reported to be labor-intensive with only limited potential for automation, and the collection of differential bands for gene identification is even more cumbersome. In this work, we present the use of dHPLC (denaturing high performance liquid chromatography) and automated DNA fragment collection using the WAVE(®) System to analyze and recover cDNA-AFLP fragments. The method is successfully applied to the Malus-Venturia inaequalis interaction, making it possible to collect 66 different transcript-derived fragments for apple genes putatively involved in the defense response activated by the HcrVf2 resistance gene. The results, validated by real time quantitative RT-PCR, were consistent with the plant-pathogen interaction under investigation and this further supports the suitability of dHPLC for cDNA-AFLP transcript profiling.

22124992,"Procyanidins (i.e. condensed tannins) are polyphenols commonly found in fruits. During juice and cider making, apple polyphenol oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of caffeoylquinic acid (CQA) into its corresponding o-quinone which further reacts with procyanidins and other polyphenols, leading to the formation of numerous oxidation products. However, the structure and the reaction pathways of these neoformed phenolic compounds are still largely unknown. Experiments were carried out on a model system to gain insights into the chemical processes occurring during the initial steps of fruit processing. Procyanidin B2 was oxidized by caffeoylquinic acid o-quinone (CQAoq) in an apple juice model solution. The reaction products were monitored using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to ultraviolet (UV)-visible and electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) in the negative mode. Oxidative conversion of procyanidin B2 ([M-H](-) at m/z 577) into procyanidin A2 at m/z 575 was unambiguously confirmed. In addition, several classes of products were characterized by their deprotonated molecules ([M-H](-)) and their MS/MS fragmentation patterns: hetero-dimers (m/z 929) and homo-dimers (m/z 1153 and 705) resulting from dimerization involving procyanidin and CQA molecules; intramolecular addition products at m/z 575, 573, 927, 1151 and 703. Interestingly, no extensive polymerization was observed. Analysis of a cider apple juice enabled comparison with the results obtained on a biosynthetic model solution. However, procyanidin A2 did not accumulate but seemed to be an intermediate in the formation of an end-product at m/z 573 for which two structural hypotheses are given. These structural modifications of native polyphenols as a consequence of oxidation probably have an impact on the organoleptic and nutritional properties of apple juices and other apple-derived foods.",Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS,"['D001628', 'D044946', 'D002392', 'D002851', 'D005638', 'D027845', 'D008958', 'D010084', 'D044945', 'D011801', 'D021241', 'D053719']","['Beverages', 'Biflavonoids', 'Catechin', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fruit', 'Malus', 'Models, Molecular', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Proanthocyanidins', 'Quinic Acid', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Characterization of procyanidin B2 oxidation products in an apple juice model solution and confirmation of their presence in apple juice by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry.,"['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000031', None, 'Q000379']","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'analogs & derivatives', None, 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22124992,2012,0,1,procyanidin B2 oxidation products in an apple juice,apple,0.2236842105263158,"['Procyanidin B2', 'polyphenol', 'procyanidin', 'caffeoylquinic acid', 'polyphenols', 'tannins', 'CQA', 'procyanidin B2', 'Procyanidins', 'o-quinone', 'caffeoylquinic acid o-quinone', 'procyanidins']",1,17
22121202,"Mass spectrometry-based imaging techniques applied to small molecules complement the growing research field of metabolomics and can be used to interpret many important biological processes occurring in plants. In untargeted imaging applications, chemical identification is a critical step since it cannot take advantage of separative techniques applied to neutral molecules (e.g. liquid chromatography). The use of high resolution spectrometers is of great help, but fragmentation experiments are often necessary. In many cases, the information on ion fragmentation is embedded in the data sets, because analytes break up during ionization, but the extraction of this information is not easy considering the complexity of the imaging data files. Here an approach is proposed for applying conventional untargeted MALDI (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization) profiling and advanced data analysis to perform imaging of metabolites in apple tissues. The pipeline, based on intensity correlation analysis, is used to extract fragmentation information from untargeted, high resolution, wide range mass spectra and to reconstruct compound-specific images which can be used for interpretation purposes.

A novel ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP), balsamin was purified from the seeds of Balsam apple, Momordica balsamina. Balsamin was purified by ion exchange chromatography on CM Sepharose and gel filtration on superdex-75. It has a molecular weight of 28 kDa as shown by SDS-PAGE analysis. Balsamin inhibits protein synthesis in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based cell free translation assay with an IC(50) of 90.6 ng ml(-1). It has RNA N-glycosidase activity and releases a 400-base long fragment termed the Endo fragment from 28S rRNA in the same manner as does saporin-6 from Saponaria officinalis. The N-terminal sequence analysis of the first 12 amino acids of balsamin revealed that it shares 83% similarity with type I RIP α-MMC from Momordica charantia and 50% similarity with β-MMC (from Momordica charantia), bryodin I (from Bryonia dioica) and luffin a (from Luffa cylindrica). Balsamin was further characterized by mass spectrometry.

This instrument configuration uses a three-way splitter device which divides the effluent from the analytical column between the two detectors with the split ratio 1:0.1 (MSD/μ-ECD) in each run. The μ-ECD was used for confirmation purposes. Validation of the method was performed on three matrices: tomato, apple, and orange. The ethyl acetate method was assayed; recovery studies were performed at 10 and 100 μg/kg. Recoveries between 70% and 120% were achieved and relative standard deviations lower than 20% (n = 5) were obtained for all pesticides and matrices studied. Limits of quantification lower than 10 μg/kg were obtained for 100% of pesticides in all of the matrices. Limits of quantification lower than 2.5 μg/kg were achieved for 77.8% of pesticides in the tomato and apple matrices, and for 72.2% of pesticides in the orange matrix.

Galactomannans, another group of gel-forming polysaccharides, consists of a (1 → 4)-linked β-D: -mannopyranosyl backbone partially substituted at O-6 with D: -galactopyranosyl side groups. In this work, we demonstrate that a statistically significant 2.7-fold increase on the multiplication rate (MR) for in vitro-grown Marubakaido (Malus prunifolia) shoots was associated with a 12.5% replacement of agar in the semi-solid culture media for a galactomannan obtained from seeds of Schizolobium paraybae. This increase on MR was due mainly to a 1.9-fold increase in the number of main branches and an 8.6-fold increase in the number of primary lateral branches.

To understand the complex biological processes occurring in the hypanthium, a proteomics approach was used to analyze the proteome from freshly harvested ripe apple fruits. A total of 290 well-resolved spots were detected using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Out of these, 216 proteins were identified representing 116 non-redundant proteins using matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and either the MASCOT or ProteinProspector engine for peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) database searching. Identified proteins were classified into 13 major functional categories. Among these, the energy metabolism class was the most represented and included 50% of proteins homologous to Arabidopsis proteins that are involved in the response to biotic and abiotic stresses, suggesting a dual role for these proteins in addition to energy metabolism. We also identified dynein heavy chain in the hypanthium although this protein has been proposed as absent from angiosperms and thus suggest that the lack of dyneins in higher plants studied to date may not be a general characteristic to angiosperm genomic organisation.

Approximately 400 isolates representing 52 taxa recovered from mixed-plant compost using cuticle baits, along with 117 pseudomonad isolates obtained from a culture collection (i.e., non-compost habitats), were evaluated. The ability of isolates to degrade the synthetic cutin polycaprolactone (PCL) was initially measured. Isolates from 23 taxa recovered from the compost degraded PCL. As well, isolates from 13 taxa of pseudomonads cleared PCL. Secondary screening measured esterase activity induced by the presence of apple cuticle using the chromogenic substrate p-nitrophenyl butyrate. Eighteen isolates representing four taxa (Alcaligenes faecalis , Bacillus licheniformis , Bacillus pumilus , and Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes) recovered from compost exhibited substantial esterase activity when grown with cuticle. In contrast, none of the pseudomonad isolates from the culture collection produced appreciable esterase activity. Although degradation of PCL was not correlated with esterase activity, isolates that were unable to degrade PCL failed to produce measureable esterase activities. Zymogram analysis indicated that the esterases produced by bacteria from compost ranged in size from 29 to 47 kDa.

Orion electrode was used to measure fluoride. The trace elements were estimated by using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer No. 6501F. The pH values in different juices were observed at different levels, and pH values of these juices were more acidic than baseline after 24 hours. As the time increased, the erosion effect became more in pineapple; grape and sugarcane juices, and they had more cariogenic trace elements like selenium, iron and manganese. So, these juices were found to be cariogenic. To conclude, orange, mousambi, mango, pomegranate, apple, chikku and watermelon juices had no erosive effect on the human enamel, with the presence of highest amount of trace elements like fluoride and phosphorous which are considered as strongly cariostatic.",Journal of the Indian Society of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry,"['D031230', 'D001628', 'D002326', 'D002327', 'D029773', 'D032084', 'D003743', 'D005459', 'D005638', 'D006801', 'D006863', 'D017736', 'D007501', 'D029561', 'D027845', 'D008345', 'D031022', 'D008422', 'D008859', 'D010758', 'D031786', 'D012643', 'D013054', 'D013997', 'D014077', 'D014131', 'D027843']","['Ananas', 'Beverages', 'Cariogenic Agents', 'Cariostatic Agents', 'Citrullus', 'Citrus sinensis', 'Dental Enamel', 'Fluorides', 'Fruit', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Ion-Selective Electrodes', 'Iron', 'Lythraceae', 'Malus', 'Manganese', 'Mangifera', 'Materials Testing', 'Microscopy, Polarization', 'Phosphorus', 'Saccharum', 'Selenium', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'Time Factors', 'Tooth Erosion', 'Trace Elements', 'Vitis']",A comparative study of pH modulation and trace elements of various fruit juices on enamel erosion: an in vitro study.,"['Q000009', 'Q000009', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000473', 'Q000032', 'Q000009', None, None, None, 'Q000009', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000009', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000009', 'Q000009', None, None, 'Q000209', 'Q000009', 'Q000009']","['adverse effects', 'adverse effects', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'pathology', 'analysis', 'adverse effects', None, None, None, 'adverse effects', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'adverse effects', 'chemistry', None, None, 'analysis', 'adverse effects', 'adverse effects', None, None, 'etiology', 'adverse effects', 'adverse effects']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21985876,2012,0,0,enamel erosion by apple juice,apple,0.11428571428571428,"['fluoride', 'selenium', 'chikku', 'iron', 'manganese', 'phosphorous']",1,8

21928828,"The infection of stored apples by the fungus  Penicillium expansum  causes the contamination of fruits and fruit-derived products with the mycotoxin patulin, which is a major issue in food safety. Fungal attack can be prevented by beneficial microorganisms, so-called biocontrol agents. Previous time-course thin layer chromatography analyses showed that the aerobic incubation of patulin with the biocontrol yeast  Rhodosporidium kratochvilovae  strain LS11 leads to the disappearance of the mycotoxin spot and the parallel emergence of two new spots, one of which disappears over time. In this work, we analyzed the biodegradation of patulin effected by LS11 through HPLC. The more stable of the two compounds was purified and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance as desoxypatulinic acid, whose formation was also quantitated in patulin degradation experiments. After  R. kratochvilovae  LS11 had been incubated in the presence of (13)C-labeled patulin, label was traced to desoxypatulinic acid, thus proving that this compound derives from the metabolization of patulin by the yeast. Desoxypatulinic acid was much less toxic than patulin to human lymphocytes and, in contrast to patulin, did not react in vitro with the thiol-bearing tripeptide glutathione. The lower toxicity of desoxypatulinic acid is proposed to be a consequence of the hydrolysis of the lactone ring and the loss of functional groups that react with thiol groups.

21892724,"The apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, infests several hawthorn species in the southern USA. Here, we tested the hypothesis that these populations could serve as reservoirs for fruit odor discrimination behaviors facilitating sympatric host race formation and speciation, specifically the recent shift from downy hawthorn (Crataegus mollis) to domestic apple (Malus domestica) in the northern USA. Coupled gas chromatography and electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD), gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and flight tunnel bioassays were used to identify the behaviorally active natal fruit volatile blends for three of the five major southern hawthorns: C. opaca (western mayhaw), C. aestivalis (eastern mayhaw), and C. rufula (a possible hybrid between C. opaca and C. aestivalis). A 6-component blend was developed for C. opaca (3-methylbutan-1-ol [44%], pentyl acetate [6%], butyl butanoate [6%], propyl hexanoate [6%], butyl hexanoate [26%], and hexyl butanoate [12%]); an 8-component blend for C. aestivalis (3-methylbutan-1-ol [2%], butyl acetate [47%], pentyl acetate [2%], butyl butanoate [12%], propyl hexanoate [1%], butyl hexanoate [25%], hexyl butanoate [9%], and pentyl hexanoate [2%]); and a 9-component blend for C. rufula (3-methylbutan-1-ol [1%], butyl acetate [57%], 3-methylbutyl acetate [3%], butyl butanoate [5%], propyl hexanoate [1%], hexyl propionate [1%], butyl hexanoate [23%], hexyl butanoate [6%], and pentyl hexanoate [3%]). Crataegus aestivalis and C. opaca-origin flies showed significantly higher levels of upwind directed flight to their natal blend in flight tunnel assays compared to the non-natal blend and previously developed apple, northern downy hawthorn, and flowering dogwood blends. Eastern and western mayhaw flies also were tested to the C. rufula blend, with eastern flies displaying higher levels of upwind flight compared with the western flies, likely due to the presence of butyl acetate in the C. aestivalis and C. rufula blends, an agonist compound for eastern mayhaw-origin flies, but a behavioral antagonist for western flies. The results discount the possibility that the apple fly was ""pre-assembled"" and originated via a recent introduction of southern mayhaw flies predisposed to accepting apple. Instead, the findings are consistent with the possibility of southern mayhaw-infesting fly host races. However, mayhaw fruits do emit several volatiles found in apple. It is, therefore, possible that the ability of the fly to evolve a preference for apple volatiles, although not the entire blend, stemmed, in part, from standing variation related to the presence of these compounds in southern mayhaw fruit.",Journal of chemical ecology,"['D000818', 'D027825', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D006790', 'D027845', 'D012903', 'D033621', 'D014481', 'D055549']","['Animals', 'Crataegus', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Malus', 'Smell', 'Tephritidae', 'United States', 'Volatile Organic Compounds']",Identification of host fruit volatiles from three mayhaw species (Crataegus series Aestivales) attractive to mayhaw-origin Rhagoletis pomonella flies in the southern United States.,"[None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000502', None, 'Q000032']","[None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'methods', None, 'metabolism', None, 'physiology', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21892724,2012,0,0,apple fly,apple,0.13559322033898305,"['butyl butanoate [6%], propyl hexanoate [6%], butyl hexanoate', 'C. opaca', 'acetate', 'pentyl acetate', 'butyl butanoate [5%], propyl hexanoate [1%], hexyl propionate', 'butyl acetate', 'pentyl hexanoate [3%', 'butyl butanoate', 'hexyl butanoate [9%], and pentyl hexanoate [2%])', 'hexyl butanoate', 'butyl hexanoate', 'propyl hexanoate [1%], butyl hexanoate']",1,16
21892448,"We describe a rapid in situ method for detecting agrochemicals on the surface or in the tissue of fruit using a portable mass spectrometer equipped with an ambient ionization source. Two such ionization methods, low temperature plasma (LTP) and paper spray (PS), were employed in experiments performed at a local grocery store. LTP was used to detect diphenylamine (DPA) directly from the skin of apples in the store and those treated after harvest with DPA were recognized by MS and MS/MS. These data therefore allowed ready distinction between organic and non-organic apples. DPA was also found within the internal tissue of purchased apples and its distribution was mapped using LTP. Similarly, thiabendazole residues were detected on the skin of treated oranges in a grocery store experiment in which paper spray was performed by wiping the orange surface with a moist commercial lens wipe and then applying a high voltage to ionize the chemicals directly from the wipe. The handheld mass spectrometer used in these measurements is capable of performing several stages of tandem mass spectrometry (up to MS(5)); the compounds on the fruit were identified by their MS/MS fragmentation patterns.

More specifically, we describe the first example of a caffeic acid (CA) MIP which has been synthesised in the form of well-defined polymer microspheres, and its use for the extraction of CA from fruit juice sample. The CA MIP was synthesised by precipitation polymerisation using 4-vinylpyridine as functional monomer, divinylbenzene-80 as crosslinker and acetonitrile:toluene (75/25, v/v) as porogen. The particle sizing and morphological characterisation of the polymers was carried out by means of scanning electron microscopy (narrow particle size distribution; ∼5 and 1.5 μm particle diameters for the MIP and NIP [non-imprinted polymer], respectively) and nitrogen sorption porosimetry (specific surface areas of 340 and 350 m(2)g(-1), and specific pore volumes of 0.17 and 0.19 cm(3)g(-1) for the MIP and NIP, respectively). The polymers were evaluated further by batch rebinding experiments, and from the derived isotherms their binding capacity and binding strength were determined (number of binding sites (N(K))=0.6 and 0.3 mmol g(-1) for the MIP and NIP, respectively, and apparent average adsorption constant (K(N))=10.0 and 1.6L mmol(-1) for the MIP and NIP, respectively). To evaluate the molecular recognition character of the MIP it was packed into a stainless steel column (50 mm × 4.6 mm i.d.) and evaluated as an HPLC-stationary phase. The mobile phase composition, flow rate, and the elution profile were then optimised in order to improve the peak shape without negatively affecting the imprinting factor (IF). Very interesting, promising properties were revealed. The imprinting factor (IF) under the optimised conditions was 11.9. Finally, when the imprinted LC column was used for the selective recognition of CA over eight related compounds, very good selectivity was obtained.

21887525,"The apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, infests several hawthorn species in the southern USA. In a companion paper, we showed that R. pomonella flies infesting two different mayhaw species (Crataegus opaca and C. aestivalis) can discriminate between volatile blends developed for each host fruit, and that these blends are different from previously constructed blends for northern fly populations that infest domestic apple (Malus domestica), downy hawthorn (Crataegus mollis), and flowering dogwood (Cornus florida). Here, we show by using coupled gas chromatography and electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD), gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and flight tunnel bioassays, that two additional southern hawthorn fly populations infesting C. viridis (green hawthorn) and C. brachyacantha (blueberry hawthorn) also can discriminate between volatile blends for each host fruit type.

Crataegus viridis and C. brachyacantha-origin flies showed significantly higher levels of upwind oriented flight to their natal blend in flight tunnel assays compared to the alternate, non-natal blend and previously developed northern host plant blends. The presence of DMNT in C. viridis and butyl acetate in C. brachyacantha appeared to be largely responsible for driving the differential response.

21870071,"A new molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) has been prepared on silica beads using the radical ""grafting from"" polymerization method for selective extraction of minor contaminant mycotoxin of patulin (PTL). After the introduction of amino groups onto the silica surface with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, azo initiator onto the silica surface was achieved by the reaction of surface amino groups with 4,4'-azobis(4-cyanopentanoic acid). The scale-up synthesis of MIP was then carried out in the presence of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid as template substitute, functional, and cross-linking monomers. The prepared sorbent was characterized using FT-IR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, elemental analysis, and the adsorption-desorption selectivity, and the capacity characteristic of the polymer was investigated by a conventional batch adsorption test and Scatchard plot analysis. The results indicated that coated polymers had specific adsorption to PTL as compared with its co-occurring 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)), at the same bulk concentration for solution of PTL and HMF, the maximum absorbance in the solid-phase extraction (SPE) method to PTL were 93.97% or 0.654 μg/mg while to HMF they were 76.89% or 0.496 μg/mg. Scatchard analysis revealed that two classes of binding sites were formed in PTL-MIP with dissociation constants of 3.2 × 10(-2) and 5.0 × 10(-3) mg/mL and the affinity binding sites of 8.029 and 1.364 mg/g, respectively. The recoveries of PTL were more than 90% for the developed MISPE and around 75% for the traditional liquid-liquid extraction in spiked apple juice samples.

21820665,"Water based samples such as flavored drinks, juices and drinking water may contain contaminants at ultra trace level belonging to different chemical classes. A novel, simple, low-cost and fast method was developed and validated for trace residue extraction of pesticides, dioxin-like PCBs and PAHs from water and water based samples followed by analysis through gas chromatography (GC) coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ToFMS). The extraction solvent type, volume; sample volume and other extraction conditions were optimized. This was achieved by extracting 10 mL sample with 250 μL chloroform by vortexing (1 min, standing time of 2 min) followed by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 5 min). The bottom organic layer (200 μL) was pipetted out, evaporated to near dryness and reconstituted in 20 μL of ethyl acetate+cyclohexane (1:9) mixture resulting in an enrichment factor of 400. The recoveries of all compounds were within 76-120% (±10%) with the method detection limit (MDL) ranging from 1 to 250 ng/L depending on the analyte response. The MDLs were 400 times lower than the instrument quantification limits that ranged from 0.4 to 100 ng/mL. The method was further validated in water based drinks (e.g. apple, lemon, pineapple, orange, grape and pomegranate juice). For the juices with suspended pulp, the extraction was carried out with 400 μL chloroform. The extract was analyzed by GC-ToFMS at both 1D and GC×GC modes to chromatographically separate closely eluting interfering compounds the effect of which could not be minimized otherwise. The resulting peak table was filtered to identify a range of compounds belonging to specific classes viz. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated, brominated, and nitro compounds. User developed scripts were employed on the basis of identification of the molecular ion and isotope clusters or other spectral characteristics.

The enantiomers were resolved by capillary gas chromatography (GC) using a commercial chiral column (BGB-172) and a temperature program from 150°C (held for 1 min) and then raised at 10°C min(-1) to 240°C (held for 10 min). This enantioselective gas chromatographic separation was combined with a clean-up/enrichment procedure based on the modification of QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) method. Co-extractives were removed with graphitized carbon black/primary secondary amine (GCB/PSA) solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges using acetonitrile:toluene (3:1, v/v) as eluent. Gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry (GC-ITMS) with electron ionization (EI) was then used for qualitative and quantitative determination of the simeconazole enantiomers. Two precursor-to-product ion transitions (m/z 121-101 and 195-153) with the best signal intensity were chosen to build the multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) acquisition method. The limits of detection for each enantiomer of simeconazole in six food products ranged between 0.4 and 0.9 μg kg(-1), which were much lower than maximum residue levels (MRLs) established by Japan.

Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was used to completely separate pesticides from matrix compounds and to focus them into a sharp zone, followed by extraction of the target zone by the TLC-MS interface. HTpSPE resulted in extracts nearly free of interference and free of matrix effects, as shown for seven chemically representative pesticides in four different matrices (apples, cucumbers, red grapes, tomatoes).

The sample preparation is based on the QuEChERS procedure involving an initial extraction step with water and acetonitrile, followed by a partitioning step after the addition of magnesium sulfate and sodium chloride. The cleanup was performed by using dispersive solid-phase extraction with a mixture of magnesium sulfate, primary secondary amine sorbent, and n-octadecylsiloxane sorbent added together to the extract.

In total 26 flavour compounds could be measured by headspace trap gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). We used the method to analyse 85 commercially available apple juices, of which 67 apple juices were not from concentrate. Our results show that apple juices not from concentrate are mainly characterised by flavour compounds responsible for fruity, ripe, and sweet aroma impressions, such as 1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, ethylbutyrate, and ethyl-2-methylbutyrate. On the contrary, apple juices made from concentrate were dominated by acetaldehyde, E-2-hexenal, 3-methyl-1-butanol, ethyl acetate, and hexanal, which are mainly responsible for sensory impressions, such as 'green, fresh, estery'.

In the present study, three monoclonal antibodies with different affinities to this modern strobilurin have been evaluated for their usefulness in the production of immunoaffinity columns suitable for the solid-phase extraction, concentration, and clean-up of residues from food commodities. Different immunosorbents were produced and characterized in terms of antibody immobilization efficiency, immunosorbent binding capacity, optimum elution conditions, and reusability. Covalent coupling of the antibodies to Sepharose-CNBr gel took place with high yield (over 90%), whereas the immunosorbent efficacy to retain the analyte (from 28 to 68%) was shown to depend on the amount and type of antibody immobilized on the support. As a matter of fact, columns prepared with the monoclonal antibody PYs5#14 were able to selectively bound up to 53 μg of pyraclostrobin per gram of beads. Acetonitrile solutions were preferred over methanolic ones for analyte elution, and some immunosorbents could be reused at least 4-6 times provided that the amount of pyraclostrobin and the volume of sample did not overload the column. Effectiveness of the selected immunoaffinity column was evidenced by the development of an extraction procedure for pyraclostrobin residues from fruit juices and further determination by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection.

21476926,"This study investigated the phenolic composition and antioxidant capacity of an ethanolic extract from the peel of the Annurca (Malus domestica var. Annurca), which is widespread in the Campania region of southern Italy. The antimicrobial effect of the extract on different pathogens was also examined. The potential antiquorum sensing activity of the extract was tested by using the microorganism Chromobacterium violaceum. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography revealed that rutin, epicatechin, dicaffeoylquinic acid, and caffeic acid were the most abundant phenolic compounds in the extract; these compounds constituted 27.43%, 24.93%, 16.14%, and 15.3% of the total phenols, respectively. The test for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl free radical-scavenging activity showed that the extract possessed an impressive antioxidant capacity (50% effective concentration of 2.50 μg/g of product). Furthermore, the extract clearly exhibited antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus (11- to 14-mm diameter of inhibition halo, depending on the strain) and Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 (10-mm diameter of inhibition halo). No activity was observed against the probiotic lactobacilli tested or against Staphylococcus aureus. Antiquorum sensing activity was reported for the first time for apple extracts.

21435473,"A molecularly imprinted film is electrochemically synthesized on a gold electrode using cyclic voltammetry to electropolymerize o-aminothiophenol in the presence of metolcarb (MTMC). The mechanism of the imprinting process and a number of factors affecting the activity of the imprinted film are discussed and optimized. Scanning electron microscope observations and binding measurements have proved that an MTMC-imprinted film (with a thickness of nearly 100 nm) was formed on the surface of the gold electrode. The film exhibited high binding affinity and selectivity towards the template MTMC, as well as good penetrability, reproducibility and stability. A novel amperometry sensor using the imprinted film as recognition element was developed for MTMC determination in food samples. Under the experimental conditions, the MTMC standard is linear within the concentration range studied (r(2)=0.9906). The limit of detection (S/N=3) of the modified electrode was achieved to 1.34×10(-8) mol L(-1).

We have developed a sensitive and selective mass spectrometry-based method to detect ricin in tap water, 2% milk, apple juice, and orange juice. Ricin added to beverage matrices was extracted using antibody-bound magnetic beads and digested with trypsin. Absolute quantification was performed using isotope dilution mass spectrometry with a linear ion trap operating in product-ion-monitoring mode. The method allows for identification of ricin A chain and B chain and for distinction of ricin from ricin agglutinin within a single analytical run. Ricin-bound beads were also tested for deadenylase activity by incubation with a synthetic ssDNA oligomer. Depurination of the substrate by ricin was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS).

Because choline esterase inhibition is more effective after conversion of thiophosphate thions into their corresponding oxons, a pre-oxidation step was added to the HPTLC-EI assay. Bromine vapour was found to be more effective than iodine or UV irradiation for oxidation. Following oxidation, the inhibitory strength of parathion, parathion-methyl, chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-methyl, and malathion, expressed as HPTLC enzyme inhibition factors (f(i)), increased by approximately 2 orders of magnitude.

21388817,"This paper describes the development of methods for the rapid screening of gross alpha (GA) and gross beta (GB) radioactivity in liquid foods, specifically, Tang drink mix, apple juice, and milk, as well as screening of GA, GB, and gamma radioactivity from surface deposition on apples. Detailed procedures were developed for spiking of matrices with (241)Am (alpha radioactivity), (90)Sr/(90)Y (beta radioactivity), and (60)Co, (137)Cs, and (241)Am (gamma radioactivity). Matrix stability studies were performed for 43 days after spiking. The method for liquid foods is based upon rapid digestion, evaporation, and flaming, followed by gas proportional (GP) counting. For the apple matrix, surface radioactivity was acid-leached, followed by GP counting and/or gamma spectrometry. The average leaching recoveries from four different apple brands were between 63% and 96%, and have been interpreted on the basis of ion transport through the apple cuticle. The minimum detectable concentrations (MDCs) were calculated from either the background or method-blank (MB) measurements. They were found to satisfy the required U.S. FDA's Derived Intervention Levels (DILs) in all but one case. The newly developed methods can perform radioactivity screening in foods within a few hours and have the potential to capacity with further automation.

Analytical methods used routinely for organic acids suffer from poor reproducibility, often give false positives/negatives for tartaric acid, and do not offer the possibility of analyte confirmation. There are conflicting reports in the literature on the presence/absence of tartaric acid in pomegranate juice, a potential indicator of adulteration with grape juice. In this work, a method based on stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry is described for citric, malic, quinic, and tartaric acid in fruit juices. Validation data including precision and recovery in six types of juice are presented. Tartaric and quinic acids were confirmed in pomegranate juice at concentrations of 1-5 and ∼1 mg/L, respectively.

21269768,"Propylthiol functionalized SBA-15 silica was investigated to detoxify aqueous solutions contaminated with the regulated mycotoxin patulin. Micelle templated silicas with a specific pore size were synthetically modified to possess propylthiol groups, a functional group known to form Michael reaction products with the conjugated double bond system of patulin. BET surface area analysis indicated the propylthiol functionalized SBA-15 possesses channels with the pore size of 5.4 nm and a surface area of 345 m(2)g(-1). Elemental analysis indicates the silicon/sulfur ratio to be 10:1, inferring one propylthiol substituent for every ten silica residues. The propylthiol modified SBA-15 was effective at significantly reducing high levels of patulin from aqueous solutions (pH 7.0) in batch sorption assays at room temperature. The material was less effective at lower pH; however heating low pH solutions and apple juice to 60 °C in the presence of propylthiol functionalized SBA-15 significantly reduced the levels of patulin in contaminated samples. Composite molecular models developed by semi-empirical PM3 and empirical force field methods support patulin permeation through the mesoporous channels of propylthiol functionalized SBA-15. Density functional study at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level predicts the proposed patulin adducts formed by reaction with the thiol residues exhibit less electrophilic properties than patulin.

21238751,"For this work, thirteen types of fruit juices (orange, pineapple, peach, apple, multifruit, mango, strawberry, tomato, pear, mandarin, grape, banana and grapefruit) were selected to develop an analytical method for the analysis of 53 pesticides by direct injection in LC-MS/MS. The preparation of the samples was very simple: an aliquot of the juice was centrifuged and it was ten-times diluted prior to analysis, which allowed reducing considerably the time and cost of the analyses. Besides, dilution of the samples permits reducing the amount of matrix going into the system, and thus, decreasing the matrix effects, so common in this type of commodities, opening the possibility to perform quantification with solvent based standards. Validation of the method was carried out in accordance with EU guidelines. Calibration curves covering three orders of magnitude were performed, and they were linear over the concentration range studied for all the matrices (from 0.1 to 100 μg L(-1)). Practical limits of quantification were in the low μg L(-1) range, far below the maximum residue levels (MRLs) of the EU regulations, which do not set specific MRLs for juices, and in this cases of processed food, MRLs of the raw product are applied. Repeatability of the instrumental method was studied in all matrices, obtaining good intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSDs). The proposed method was applied to 106 real fruit juice samples purchased in different local markets during a one-year survey in order to validate the suitability for routine analysis. 43% of the analysed samples gave positive results (higher than the practical limits of quantification).",Talanta,"['D001628', 'D002853', 'D005060', 'D005638', 'D010573', 'D010865', 'D053719']","['Beverages', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Europe', 'Fruit', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Pilot Projects', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",Pesticide residue analysis of fruit juices by LC-MS/MS direct injection.

Oxygen pressurized atmosphere was used to improve the digestion efficiency and Al, Ca, K, Fe, Mg and Na were determined in digests by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES). Efficiency of digestion was evaluated taking into account the residual carbon content (RCC) and residual acidity in digests. Samples were digested using nitric acid solutions (2, 3, 7, and 14 mol L(-1) HNO(3)) and the effect of gas phase composition inside the reaction vessels by purging the vessel with Ar (inert atmosphere, 1 bar), air (20% of oxygen, 1 bar) and pure O(2) (100% of oxygen, 1 bar) was evaluated. The influence of oxygen pressure was studied using pressures of 5, 10, 15 and 20 bar. It was demonstrated that a diluted nitric acid solution as low as 3 mol L(-1) was suitable for an efficient digestion of sample masses up to 500 mg of botanical samples using 5 bar of oxygen pressure.

21193007,"This work aimed at isolation and identification of patulin producing fungi and to follow the presence of patulin during apple juice processing. Among 34 Penicillium isolates, eight isolates (five from healthy appeared apples and 12 from rot spotted apples) were considered as patulin producers using thin-layer chromatography. These isolates were classically identified as a Penicillium expansum. PCR utilizing primers based on the polygalacturonase gene of P. expansum was applied for detecting this mold. The PCR amplified a 404-bp DNA product from all tested P. expansum isolates, but not in other common food spoilage Penicillium species. RAPD technique using P1 or M13 primers was applied to determine the similarity of the P. expansum isolates. RAPD results revealed that the tested strains showed high percentage of similarity and no correlation was observed between cluster analysis and the sources of isolation. Patulin could not be detected in healthy appeared apples and their extracted juice during different stages of juice process. In apple juice made from the healthy parts of apples decayed by P. expansum contained patulin which may present health hazard. The obtained results assured that patulin is known to be stable in apple juice even after pasteurization. In conclusion, the removal of the rotten part from the fruit is not sufficient to eliminate the mycotoxin patulin from apple juice. Although, the enzyme treatment (pectinase and amylase) and pasteurization (95 °C for 7 min) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced patulin level, its level is still higher than the level of <50 μg/kg considered by Codex alimentarius when the apple juice processed from the healthy parts of rot spotted fruits.",Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,"['D001628', 'D002855', 'D016000', 'D005838', 'D027845', 'D010365', 'D010407', 'D011096', 'D016133', 'D019105']","['Beverages', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Genotype', 'Malus', 'Patulin', 'Penicillium', 'Polygalacturonase', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique']",Genotypic identification of Penicillium expansum and the role of processing on patulin presence in juice.,"['Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None, None]","['analysis', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'genetics', 'genetics', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21193007,2011,0,0,PAT isolation by bacteria,apple,0.1111111111111111,"['mycotoxin patulin', 'Patulin', 'patulin', 'fungi']",1,9
30743679,"In northern Italy, blue mold can occur generally on apples after 3 months of storage under controlled atmospheres. The mold can be caused by Penicillium griseofulvum Dierckx (synonym P. urticae Bainier). During 2008, several postharvest fruit rots were observed on apples (cv. Golden Delicious) after 180 to 240 days of storage at 1°C. Approximately 8% of the fruits showed blue mold. Apples had been cultivated in Aosta (Aosta Valley Region) and Lagnasco (Piedmont Region). Infected fruits showed soft, watery, brown spots enlarging rapidly at 20°C. There was a distinct margin between soft rotted flesh and firm healthy tissues. Under high humidity, masses of blue-green spores formed on the surface of the lesion. Apple fruit excisions from the margin between the healthy and diseased tissues were plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA), pH 5.6. The recovered fungus produced abundant mycelium and conidia, with the colonies attaining a diameter of 2.0 to 2.4 cm after 7 days at 20 ± 2°C on PDA. Colonies were mostly yellow-green, with a yellowish-to-orange brown underside. Conidiophores were mononematous or loosely synnematous, hyaline, with branches strongly divergent. Phialides were cylindrical with a very short neck. Conidia were ellipsoidal, sometimes subglobose, 2.5 to 3.5 × 2.2 to 2.5 μm, hyaline to greenish. Preliminary morphological identification of the fungus (2) was confirmed by PCR using genomic DNA extracted from mycelia of pure cultures. Two sequences, obtained through the amplification of ribosomal region ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (1), were blast searched in GenBank and showed 99% sequence coverage and 99% similarity to ribosomal sequences of P. griseofulvum. Two sequences were deposited in GenBank with Accession Nos. HQ012498 (a strain from Aosta Valley) and HQ012499 (a strain from the Piedmont Region). Pathogenicity was tested on 20 ripe fruits each of four apple cultivars (Golden Delicious, Red Chief, Granny Smith, and Royal Gala). Fruits were surface sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite. Conidial suspensions (30 μl of 105 conidia/ml) of the fungus were placed on artificial wounds generated on the apple surface. Control fruits were treated with sterile water. Seven days after inoculation, the symptoms were reproduced on the four cultivars and P. griseofulvum was reisolated on PDA from the inoculated fruits of all four cultivars. Control fruits were symptomless. An analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array of the rotting tissues associated with inoculated fruits of all four cultivars (4) confirmed, as in the case of other strains of P. griseofulvum, the production of the mycotoxin patulin (12.1 to 44.4 mg kg",Plant disease,[],[],First Report of Penicillium griseofulvum Causing Blue Mold on Stored Apples in Italy (Piedmont).,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30743679,2019,1,0,Mold,apple,0.03571428571428571,"['ITS1-5.8S-ITS2', 'HQ012499', 'sodium hypochlorite', 'Penicillium griseofulvum Dierckx', 'HQ012498']",1,5

21174194,"A method for analysis of diethofencarb and pyrimethanil in apple pulp and peel was developed by using dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction based on solidification of a floating organic droplet (DLLME-SFO) and high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD). Acetonitrile was used as the solvent to extract the two fungicides from apple pulp and peel, assisted by microwave irradiation. When the extraction process was finished, the target analytes in the extraction solvent were rapidly transferred from the acetonitrile extract to another extraction solvent (1-undecanol) by using DLLME-SFO. Because of the lower density of 1-undecanol than that of water, the finely dispersed droplets of 1-undecanol collected on the top of aqueous sample and solidified at low temperature. Meanwhile, the tiny particles of apple cooled and precipitated. Recovery was tested for a concentration of 8 μg kg⁻¹. Recovery of diethofencarb and pyrimethanil from apple pulp and peel was in the range 83.5-101.3%. The repeatability of the method, expressed as relative standard deviation, varied between 4.8 and 8.3% (n = 6). Detection limits of the method for apple pulp and peel varied from 1.2-1.6 μg kg⁻¹ for the two fungicides.

21157860,"A rapid screening method for pesticides has been developed to promote more efficient processing of produce entering the United States. Foam swabs were used to recover a multiclass mixture of 132 pesticides from the surfaces of grapes, apples, and oranges. The swabs were analyzed using direct analysis in real time (DART) ionization coupled with a high-resolution Exactive Orbitrap™ mass spectrometer. By using a DART helium temperature gradient from 100-350°C over 3 min, a minimal separation of analytes based on volatility differences was achieved. This, combined with the Exactive's mass resolution of 100,00, allowed the chromatographic step, along with the typical compositing and extraction steps associated with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) approaches, to be eliminated. Detection of 86% of the analytes present was consistently achieved at levels of 2 ng/g (per each apple or orange) and 10 ng/g (per grape). A resolution study was conducted with four pairs of isobaric compounds analyzed at a mass resolution of 100 000. Baseline separation was achieved with analyte ions differing in mass by 25 ppm and analyte ions with a mass difference of 10 ppm were partially resolved. In addition, field samples that had undergone traditional sample preparation using QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, rugged, and safe) were analyzed using both LC/MS and DART-MS and the results from the two techniques were found to be comparable in terms of identification of the pesticides present.

20831276,"Grape and apple condensed tannin fractions were autoxidized at high concentrations (5 g/L) in aqueous solutions and analyzed by thiolysis (depolymerization followed by HPLC analysis) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Structural parameters of native (unoxidized) tannin polymers were derived from SAXS according to the wormlike chain model: the length per monomer is 15 A, the length of the statistical segment 17 A, and the cross section of the macromolecule has a radius within the range 3-4.5 A. The rather short length of the statistical segment is an effect of the different location of interflavanol linkages, which cause a loss of orientational correlation between successive monomers. Oxidation created new bonds that were resistant to thiolysis, and, according to thiolysis, some of these new bonds were intramolecular. However, according to SAXS, oxidation at high tannin concentration caused the weight average degree of polymerization to increase, indicating that intermolecular reactions took place as well, creating larger macromolecules. In the case of the smaller grape seed tannins, these intermolecular reactions took place ""end to end"" leading to the formation of longer linear macromolecules, at least in the earlier stages of oxidation. In the case of the larger apple tannins, the SAXS patterns were characteristic of larger branched macromolecules. Accordingly, the intermolecular reactions were mainly ""end to middle"".

Analytical separation of the quinoxalines from the epimeric glucose-derived quinoxalines of 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG) and glucosone was achieved by RP-HPLC on an RP-phenyl column. This method was used to study the relevance of galactose-derived 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds in a variety of foods. 3-DG and 3-DGal were quantified besides 3-deoxypentosone, methylglyoxal, and glyoxal after derivatization with o-phenylenediamine in lactose-hydrolyzed UHT milk, ranging from 2.5 to 18 mg/L and from 2.0 to 11 mg/L, respectively. The concentrations of both compounds tended to be higher in other lactose-hydrolyzed food items as well. During storage of lactose-hydrolyzed milk, the concentrations of the 3-deoxyhexosones first increased, but especially the concentration of 3-DGal tended to decrease on prolonged storage, pointing to lower stability of the compound. 3-DGal was also detected in galactose-free food items such as apple juice and beer. The possible formation of 3-DGal from 3-DG by 3,4-dideoxyglucosone-3-ene as an intermediate is discussed.

20707156,"Aiming at spectral detection of apple fluorescence canopy, the present paper carried out spectral detection tests under different weather conditions, different detection times, and different detection heights and angles to apple canopy in the two years of 2008 and 2009, so as to analyze impacts of these factors on apple canopy spectral characteristics and explore standardized spectral detection methods for apple fluorescence canopy. The results indicated the regularity in spectral reflectance of apple fluorescence canopy to a certain degree under different conditions, especially in the 760-1 350 nm near-infrared bands. The authors found that canopy spectral reflectance declined along with the decrease in sunshine and it is appropriate to detect canopy spectrum in sunny days with few clouds. In addition, spectral reflectance tended to be stable when the wind scale was below grade 2. The discrepancy of canopy spectra is small during the time period from 10:00 to 15:00 of a day compared to that of other times. For maintaining stable spectral curves, the height of detector to apple canopy needed to be adjusted to cover the whole canopy within the field of view according to detection angle of the detector. The vertical or approximately vertical detection was the best for canopy spectral reflectance acquisition. The standardization of technical methods of spectral detection for apple fluorescence canopy was proposed accordingly, which provided theoretical references for spectral detection and information extraction of apple tree canopy.",Guang pu xue yu guang pu fen xi = Guang pu,"['D027845', 'D013050', 'D013472']","['Malus', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Sunlight']",[Standardization of technical methods for apple fluorescence canopy spectral detection].,"[None, 'Q000592', None]","[None, 'standards', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20707156,2015,0,0,apple trees,apple,0.0,[],1,0

The proportions of liquid-phase of the slurries composed by HCl, HNO(3) and Triton X-100 solutions have been optimized applying a constrained mixture design. The optimized conditions were 200mg of sample ground in a tungsten carbide balls mill (particle size<100 microm), dilution in a liquid-phase composed by 2.0 mol L(-1) nitric, 2.0 mol L(-1) hydrochloric acid and 2.5% Triton X-100 solutions (in the proportions of 50%, 12% and 38% respectively), sonication time of 10 min and final slurry volume of 50.0 mL. This method allowed the determination of manganese and zinc by FAAS, with detection limits of 0.46 and 0.66 microg g(-1), respectively. The precisions, expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD), are 6.9 and 5.5% (n=10), for concentrations of manganese and zinc of 20 and 40 microg g(-1), respectively.

20566341,"Apple juice samples intended for infants purchased in Navarra (Spain) have been analyzed for PAT occurrence. Two capillary electrophoresis methods, based on a MEKC and a CEC system, and an HPLC method were evaluated for the aforementioned study. The CEC system gave less satisfying separations and several practical problems, so samples have been analyzed by MEKC and HPLC. Both methods have been comparable in terms of recovery, precision, limits of detection, volume of organic solvents used and adequate selectivity with regard to PAT and HMF. The analysis time in HPLC has been slightly lower than in the MEKC methodology. The PAT levels obtained in apple juice by both validated methods showed a strong correlation (p<0.001). Therefore, both methodologies are useful for the accurate quantification of patulin in this matrix.

20560532,"A novel cyanide analyzer based on sensitive cobinamide chemistry relies on simultaneous reagent and sample injection and detection in a 50 cm liquid core waveguide (LCW) flow cell illuminated by a white light emitting diode. The transmitted light is read by a fiber-optic charge coupled device (CCD) spectrometer. Alkaline cobinamide (orange, lambda(max) = 510 nm) changes to violet (lambda(max) = 583 nm) upon reaction with cyanide. Multiwavelength detection permits built-in correction for artifact responses intrinsic to a single-line flow injection system and corrects for drift. With optimum choice of the reaction medium, flow rate, and mixing coil length, the limit of detection (LOD, S/N = 3) is 30 nM and the linear dynamic range extends to 10 microM. The response base width for 1% carryover is <95 s, permitting a throughput of 38 samples/h. The relative standard deviations (rsd) for repetitive determinations at 0.15, 0.5, and 1 microM were 7.6% (n = 5), 3.2% (n = 7), and 1.7% (n = 6), respectively.

All subunits of both proteins are glycosylated and appear to be glycoforms with isoelectric points ranging from approximately 5.3 to approximately 9.1. Complete deglycosylation reduced subunit heterogeneity to spots of similar molecular weight (approximately 27 and approximately 25 kDa in scalarin and ovorubin, respectively) but with varying IP. Serine phosphorylation, present in both perivitellins, explains part of the isoforms. Glycosylation patterns of scalarin were determined using biotinylated lectins, PNGaseF treatment and selective chemical deglycosylation, which revealed the presence of hybrid and oligomannose N-linked glycans in all subunits. Scalarin has terminal sialic acid residues possibly resistant to neuraminidase and O-linked residues derived from the T- and Tn antigens. Ovorubin displayed predominantly the same glycans, though in different amounts.

20462590,"The most straightforward method to analyze an obtained GC-MS dataset is to integrate those peaks that can be identified by their MS profile and to perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This procedure has some important drawbacks, like baseline drifts being scarcely considered or the fact that integration boundaries are not always well defined (long tails, co-eluted peaks, etc.). To improve the methodology, and therefore, the chromatographic data analysis, this work proposes the modeling of the raw dataset by using PARAFAC2 algorithm in selected areas of the GC profile and using the obtained well-resolved chromatographic profiles to develop a further PCA model. With this working method, not only the problems arising from instrumental artifacts are overcome, but also the detection of new analytes is achieved as well as better understanding of the studied dataset is obtained. As a positive consequence of using the proposed working method human time and work are saved. To exemplify this methodology the aroma profile of 36 apples being ripened were studied. The benefits of the proposed methodology (PARAFAC2+PCA) are shown in a practitioner perspective, being able to extrapolate the conclusions obtained here to other hyphenated chromatographic datasets.",Journal of chromatography.

Phenolics were extracted from fresh apples with methanol, and sugars were removed from the crude extract by treatment with Amberlite resin before fractionating the proanthocyanidins into ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate fraction was chromatographed on Toyopearl TSK HW-50F to yield about 50 mg of procyanidin dimer and 35 mg of trimer from 1 kg fresh apple fruit. The purity and identity of the standards was easily confirmed by using ESI-MS. In the acid butanol assay, the pure dimer, trimer and purified Sorghum procyanidin had similar color yields on a mass basis, and produced about three times more color than purified quebracho tannin.

Results indicate that PV2 is a compact and well folded oligomer of 130x44 A. It is an octamer of four 98 kDa heterodimers composed of 67 and 31 kDa subunits. Subunits are held together by disulfide bonds. Dimers are assembled into native PV2 by non-covalent forces. The larger subunit is more susceptible to proteolysis, indicating it is less compactly folded and/or more exposed. Quenching of tryptophan fluorescence showed a single class of tryptophyl side chains occluded in hydrophobic regions. Native structure shows loss of secondary structure (alpha+beta) at 6 M urea or 60-70 degrees C; the effects on the quaternary structure suggest an unfolding without disassembling of the protein.

20183066,"A fast, simple and inexpensive method has been developed for the analysis of phenoxy acid herbicides: 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), 2-(4-chloro-o-tolyloxy)propionic acid (MCPP), 2-(4-aryloxyphenoxy)propionic acid (Fluazifop) and 2-(4-aryloxyphenoxy)propionic acid (Haloxyfop) in carrots and apples by liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The compounds were analyzed by QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, safe) methodology without cleanup. The recoveries were performed at two spiked levels (0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg) for both matrices with six replicates for each level. The mean recoveries ranged from 70-92% for both apples and carrots. The precision of the method expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD%) was found to be in the range 3-15%. For all compounds, good linearity (r(2) > 0.99) was obtained over the range of concentration from 0.05 micro g/mL to 0.5 micro g/mL, corresponding to the pesticide concentrations of 0.05 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg, respectively. The determination limits (LOQs) ranged from 0.01 ng/mL to 1.3 ng/mL in solvent, whereas, the LOQs calculated in matrix ranged from 0.05 ng/g to 21.0 ng/g for apples and from 0.06 ng/g to 10.2 ng/g for carrots.

20172528,"The gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) deconvolution reporting software (DRS) from Agilent Technologies has been evaluated for its ability as a screening tool to detect a large number of pesticides in incurred and fortified samples extracted with acetone/dichloromethane/light petroleum (Mini-Luke method). The detection of pesticides is based on fixed retention times using retention time locking (RTL) and full scan mass spectral comparison with a partly customer built automated mass spectral deconvolution and identification system (AMDIS) database. The GC-MS was equipped with a programmable temperature vaporising (PTV) injector system which enables more sample to be injected. In a blind study of 52 real samples a total number of 158 incurred pesticides were found. In addition to the 85 pesticides found by manual interpretation of GC-NPD/ECD chromatograms, the DRS revealed 73 more pesticides (+46%). The DRS system also shows its potential to discover pesticides which are normally not searched for (EPN in long beans from Thailand). A spiking experiment was performed to blank matrices of apple, orange and lettuce with 177 different pesticides at concentration levels 0.02 and 0.1 mg/kg. The samples were analysed on GC-MS full scan and the AMDIS match factor was used as a mass spectral quality criterion. The threshold level of the AMDIS match factor was set at 20 to eliminate most of the false positives. AMDIS match factors from 20 up to 69 are regarded only as indication of a positive hit and must be followed by manual interpretation. Pesticides giving AMDIS match factors at > or = 70 are regarded as identified. To simplify and decrease the large amount of data generated at each concentration level, the AMDIS match factors > or = 20 was averaged (mean AMF) for each pesticide including the commodities and their replicates. Among 177 different pesticides spiked at 0.02 and 0.1 mg/kg level, the percentage of mean AMF values > or = 70 were 23% and 80%, respectively. For 531 individual detections of pesticides (177 pesticides x 3 replicates) giving AMDIS match factor 20 in apple, orange and lettuce, the detection rates at 0.02 mg/kg were 71%, 63% and 72%, respectively. For the 0.1 mg/kg level the detection rates were 89%, 85% and 89%, respectively. In real samples some manual interpretation must be performed in addition. However, screening by GC-MS/DRS is about 5-10 times faster compared to screening with GC-NPD/ECD because the time used for manual interpretation is much shorter and there is no need for re-injection on GC-MS for the identification of suspect peaks found on GC-NPD/ECD.",Journal of chromatography.

Thus, they are used in organic farming for soil or foliar applications. The European Union is for health reasons interested in reducing copper in apple orchards. Because the fertilizer application rate affects the nutrition of apples, the applied copper might also be reflected in the copper concentration of apple juices. Thus, the determination of copper is of concern for investigating the application of copper-containing fertilizers. Samples of clarified apple juice commercially available in the European market were analyzed for their copper content. Prior to quantification by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry, the juices were processed by a microwave-assisted digestion system using HNO(3). All samples were also measured directly after dilution with HNO(3).

20144460,"This article describes the comparison of different versions of an easy, rapid and low-cost sample preparation approach for the determination of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables by concurrent use of gas and liquid chromatography (GC and LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) for detection. The sample preparation approach is known as QuEChERS, which stands for ""quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe"". The three compared versions were based on the original unbuffered method, which was first published in 2003, and two interlaboratory validated versions: AOAC Official Method 2007.01, which uses acetate buffering, and European Committee for Standardization (CEN) Standard Method EN 15662, which calls for citrate buffering. LC-MS/MS and GC-MS analyses using each method were tested from 50 to 1000ng/g in apple-blueberry sauce, peas and limes spiked with 32 representative pesticides. As expected, the results were excellent (overall average of 98% recoveries with 10% RSD) using all 3 versions, except the unbuffered method gave somewhat lower recoveries for the few pH-dependent pesticides. The different methods worked equally well for all matrices tested with equivalent amounts of matrix co-extractives measured, matrix effects on quantification and chemical noise from matrix in the chromatographic backgrounds. The acetate-buffered version gave higher and more consistent recoveries for pymetrozine than the other versions in all 3 matrices and for thiabendazole in limes. None of the versions consistently worked well for chlorothalonil, folpet or tolylfluanid in peas, but the acetate-buffered method gave better results for screening of those pesticides. Also, due to the recent shortage in acetonitrile (MeCN), ethyl acetate (EtOAc) was evaluated as a substitute solvent in the acetate-buffered QuEChERS version, but it generally led to less clean extracts and lower recoveries of pymetrozine, thiabendazole, acephate, methamidophos, omethoate and dimethoate. In summary, the acetate-buffered version of QuEChERS using MeCN exhibited advantages compared to the other tested methods in the study.",Journal of chromatography.

20060788,"Esterase inhibition assays provide an effect-directed tool of rapid screening for inhibitors in environmental and food samples. According to a multi-enzyme microtiter-plate assay, rabbit liver esterase (RLE), Bacillus subtilis esterase (BS2), and cutinase from Fusarium solani pisi (CUT) were used for the detection of 21 organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides by high-performance thin-layer chromatography-enzyme inhibition assays (HPTLC-EI). Staining was performed with Fast Blue Salt B coupling to alpha-naphthol enzymatically released from the respective acetate used as substrate. Quantitative analysis was achieved by densitometric evaluation at 533 nm. Enzyme inhibition factors derived from HPTLC-EI were calculated from the slopes of the linear calibration curves, which allowed comparisons to published inhibition constants and well correlated to sensitivity parameters. Limits of detection ranged from a few pg/zone for organophosphates as strongest inhibitors to a few ng/zone for most carbamates, when RLE and BS2 were used. Without oxidation, chlorpyrifos and parathion were directly detectable at approximately 60 and 14 ng/zone, respectively. As the enzyme of lowest sensitivity, CUT was able to detect insecticides of high and low inhibitory power from the ng to microg range per zone. Due to high selectivity of enzyme inhibition, oxon impurities of thionophosphate standards were strongly detected, although only present in low traces. The exemplary application of HPTLC-EI (RLE) to apple juice and drinking water samples spiked with paraoxon (0.001 mg/L), parathion (0.05 mg/L) and chlorpyrifos (0.5mg/L) resulted in mean recoveries between 71 and 112% with standard deviations of 2.0-18.3%.","Journal of chromatography.

The approach described here has proven to be a useful analytical tool for unbiased pattern comparison or profiling analyses, as demonstrated with the differentiation of volatile patterns (""aroma"") from fruits such as apples, pears, and quince fruit. These volatile patterns were generated by headspace solid phase microextraction coupled to comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (HS-SPME-GC x GC). The data obtained from GC x GC chromatograms were used as contour plots which were then converted to gray-scale images and analyzed utilizing a workflow derived from 2D gel-based proteomics. Run-to-run variations between GC x GC chromatograms, respectively their contour plots, have been compensated by image warping. The GC x GC images were then merged into a fusion image yielding a defined and project-wide spot (peak) consensus pattern. Within detected spot boundaries of this consensus pattern, relative quantities of the volatiles from each GC x GC image have been calculated, resulting in more than 700 gap free volatile profiles over all samples. These profiles have been used for multivariate statistical analysis and allowed clustering of comparable sample origins and prediction of unknown samples.

In this study, six fruit extracts (apple, blueberry, mangosteen, longan, dragon fruit with white flesh, and dragon fruit with red flesh) were compared for their activities against acrylamide formation in chemical models containing equal molar quantities of glucose and asparagine in distilled water (160 degrees C for 30 min). Apple extract demonstrated potent inhibition on acrylamide formation. Blueberry, mangosteen, and longan extracts did not have significant impact, whereas dragon fruit extracts enhanced acrylamide formation. Column chromatography guided by chemical model analysis showed that the proanthocyanidin-rich subfraction played a key role in mediating the inhibitory activity.

Samples were coated with two enzyme treated apple pectins; modified hairy regions (MHR-A and MHR-B) that differed in chemical structure. Aminated (AMI) and uncoated titanium (Ti) served as controls. The thicknesses of the peri-implant fibrous tissue capsules formed 1 or 3 weeks after implantation were measured as indicative of possible inflammatory reactions toward the biomaterials. After 1 week, the MHR-B implant was surrounded by a thicker fibrous capsule (42.9 microm) than any of the other sample types: MHR-A (33.2 microm), AMI (32.5 microm), and Ti (32.3 microm), the last one being the only statistically significant difference. After 3 weeks, however, this difference disappeared; the capsule thicknesses around MHR-B and Ti implants had decreased to the values found for AMI and MHR-A. Additionally, the capsule formation represents merely a stromal rather than an inflammatory reaction, as indicated by the absence of activated macrophages or foreign body giant cells in the capsules.

19896138,"A method for the rapid trace analysis of 24 residual pesticides in apple juice by multidimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MD-GC/MS) using dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) was developed and optimized. Several parameters of the extraction procedure such as type and volume of extraction solvent, type and volume of dispersive solvent and salt addition were evaluated to achieve the highest yield and to attain the lowest detection limits. The DLLME procedure optimized consists in the formation of a cloudy solution promoted by the fast addition to the sample (5 ml) of a mixture of carbon tetrachloride (extraction solvent, 100 microl) and acetone (dispersive solvent, 400 microl). The tiny droplets formed and dispersed among the aqueous sample solution are further joined and sedimented (85 microl) in the bottom of the conical test tube by centrifugation. Once extracted, all the 24 pesticides were directly injected and separated by a dual GC column system, comprising a short wide-bore DB-5 capillary column with low film thickness connected by a Deans switch system to a second chromatographic narrower column, with identical stationary phase. The instrumental setting used, in combination with carefully optimized operational fast GC and MS parameters, markedly decreased the retention times of the targeted analytes.

19835358,"Erwinia amylovora causes fire blight, a serious disease of apple and pear. The bacterial pathogen colonizes the flower stigma and hypanthium, where it multiplies and then invades through natural openings (nectarthodes). E. amylovora requires nicotinic acid as growth factor, and competition for nicotinic acid is being explored as a novel biocontrol strategy. The ability of E. amylovora to substitute nicotinic acid with analogues or derivates as growth factors has not been investigated yet. Furthermore, the presence and/or variable concentration of nicotinic acid and its analogues/derivates in the hypanthium could be associated with the different susceptibilities to fire blight of hosts and nonhosts and with the differential sensitivity to the disease among apple and pear varieties. Currently, no methods to specifically quantify nicotinic acid and nicotinic acid analogues/derivates in the hypanthium of apple and pear blossoms are available. This study demonstrates that E. amylovora can grow using nicotinamide and 6-hydroxynicotinic acid as alternative growth factors to nicotinic acid, but not using 2-hydroxynicotinic acid. A novel HPLC/ES-MS method was developed for the detection and quantification of nicotinic acid and its analogues/derivates directly in the hypanthium of apple and pear blossoms. Analyses established the presence of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, whereas no detectable amounts of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid and 2-hydroxynicotinic acid were observed. Mean nicotinic acid content in the pear hypanthium was found to be approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than in the apple hypanthium, which may contribute to the differential susceptibility of these two host species to fire blight. Contents of nicotinamide were in contrast similar. Nicotinic acid can therefore be considered a relevant factor in the pathogen establishment in pear blossoms, whereas nicotinamide could cover a primary role in apple blossoms.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D002851', 'D044084', 'D035264', 'D027845', 'D008968', 'D009525', 'D010935', 'D031989', 'D021241']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Erwinia amylovora', 'Flowers', 'Malus', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Niacin', 'Plant Diseases', 'Pyrus', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",Determination and confirmation of nicotinic acid and its analogues and derivates in pear and apple blossoms using high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.,"['Q000379', 'Q000502', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000031', 'Q000382', 'Q000737', 'Q000295']","['methods', 'physiology', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'analogs & derivatives', 'microbiology', 'chemistry', 'instrumentation']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19835358,2010,0,0,flower diseases,apple,0.16483516483516483,"['nectarthodes', 'HPLC/ES-MS', 'acid', 'nicotinamide']",1,15

In this study, we investigated the effect of feeding, aging, photoperiod, and time of day on pheromone release by S. acupuncatus males under laboratory conditions. The pheromone released by individual males was sampled using solid-phase microextraction and analyzed by gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry. Our results show that food is an important factor because weevils deprived of plant material did not release any pheromone. In addition, we found that males fed with apple, a nonhost plant, released less pheromone than weevils fed with agave. Host odor does not seem to be important in stimulating pheromone release. We found that males as young as 1 mo were able to release pheromone, although the numbers of individuals releasing pheromone increased with age. Older males released more pheromone than younger males. We found that S. acupuncatus males released pheromone during the photophase and scotophase; there was, however, no significant peak in pheromone release.

19788278,"A reagentless bioactive paper-based solid-phase biosensor was developed for detection of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, including organophosphate pesticides. The assay strip is composed of a paper support (1 x 10 cm), onto which AChE and a chromogenic substrate, indophenyl acetate (IPA), were entrapped using biocompatible sol-gel derived silica inks in two different zones (e.g., sensing and substrate zones). The assay protocol involves first introducing the sample to the sensing zone via lateral flow of a pesticide-containing solution. Following an incubation period, the opposite end of the paper support is placed into distilled deionized water (ddH(2)O) to allow lateral flow in the opposite direction to move paper-bound IPA to the sensing area to initiate enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis of the substrate, causing a yellow-to-blue color change.

The sensor strip showed negligible matrix effects in detection of pesticides in spiked milk and apple juice samples.

19783253,"A simple and rapid single-drop microextraction method coupled with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (SDME-GC/MS) for the determination of 20 pesticides with different physicochemical properties in grapes and apples was optimized by the use of a multivariate strategy. Emphasis on the optimization study was given to the role of ionic strength, sugar concentration and pH of the donor sample solution prepared from the fruit samples. Since all three variables were found to affect negatively SDME (a lower extraction efficiency was observed as the values of variables were increased for most of the pesticides studied), donor sample solution was optimized using a central composite design to evaluate the optimum pH value and the optimum dilution of the sample extract. With some exceptions (chlorpyrifos ethyl, alpha-endosulfan, beta-endosulfan, pyriproxyfen, lambda-cyhalothrin and bifenthrin), the optimum method included the dilution of the analytical sample by 12.5-fold with a buffered acetone/water solution at pH=4 and exhibited good analytical characteristics for the majority of target analytes (pyrimethanil, pirimicarb, metribuzin, vinclozolin, fosthiazate, procymidone, fludioxonil, kresoxim methyl, endosulfan sulfate, fenhexamid, iprodione, phosalone, indoxacarb and azoxystrobin) by providing high enrichment factors (14-328), low limits of detection (0.0003-0.007 microg/g), and good precision (relative standard deviations below 15%).",Journal of chromatography.

19733738,"Liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry--LC/ESI/MS--a primary tool for analysis of low volatility compounds in difficult matrices--suffers from the matrix effects in the ESI ionization. It is well known that matrix effects can be reduced by sample dilution. However, the efficiency of simple sample dilution is often limited, in particular by the limit of detection of the method, and can strongly vary from sample to sample. In this study matrix effect is investigated as the function of dilution. It is demonstrated that in some cases dilution can eliminate matrix effect, but often it is just reduced. Based on these findings we propose a new quantitation method based on consecutive dilutions of the sample and extrapolation of the analyte content to the infinite dilution, i.e. to matrix-free solution. The method was validated for LC/ESI/MS analysis of five pesticides (methomyl, thiabendazole, aldicarb, imazalil, methiocarb) in five matrices (tomato, cucumber, apple, rye and garlic) at two concentration levels (0.5 and 5.0 mg kg(-1)). Agreement between the analyzed and spiked concentrations was found for all samples. It was demonstrated that in terms of accuracy of the obtained results the proposed extrapolative dilution approach works distinctly better than simple sample dilution. The main use of this approach is envisaged for (a) method development/validation to determine the extent of matrix effects and the ways of overcoming them and (b) as a second step of analysis in the case of samples having analyte contents near the maximum residue limits (MRL).",Analytica chimica acta,[],[],Combating matrix effects in LC/ESI/MS: the extrapolative dilution approach.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19733738,2009,0,0,spiked apple,apple,0.06578947368421052,"['imazalil, methiocarb', 'methomyl', 'analyte', 'aldicarb', 'thiabendazole']",1,5

To produce large amount of pure patulin for research purposes, high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (prep-HPLC) were applied to the purification of patulin. Apple juice was inoculated with P. expansum and containing 0.5 mg patulin per ml was used as a starting material for separation. For HSCCC, a biphasic solvent system consisted of ethyl acetate-hexane-pH 4 acetic acid (7.5:2.5:10, v/v/v) was used. For prep-HPLC, the separation was carried out in a C18 reversed-phase preparative column with a mobile phase containing acetonitrile-pH 4 acetic acid (5:95, v/v). Fractions containing patulin were collected and analysed by analytical HPLC and identified by congruent retention time and ultraviolet/visible (UV-VIS) spectrum of the standard. The structure of the purified patulin was confirmed by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. HSCCC produced 21.9 mg of patulin from 50 ml apple juice culture whereas the prep-HPLC yielded 18.1 mg. HSCCC also produced purer patulin than the prep-HPLC (98.6 versus 96.3%) and higher recovery (86.2 versus 71.3%).

Similar isomerization equilibrium constants and activation energies were observed for both all-trans-beta-carotene and all-trans-beta-cryptoxanthin. The curves for the decay of the main carotenoids and color changes showed a biphasic behavior that was best fitted by a biexponential equation. For the same heating conditions (60 or 90 degrees C), similar rate constants for the fast (gamma(1)) and slow (gamma(2)) decays were obtained for both the chemical (carotenoids) and physical (color) parameters monitored in the present research. This fact indicates that color parameters, such as DeltaE*, are good predictors of both all-trans-beta-cryptoxanthin and all-trans-beta-carotene thermal degradation.

Pesticides were extracted from infant foods by using the procedure known as the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method. Quantification was based on matrix-matched standard calibration curves with the use of an isotopically labeled standard or a chemical analogue as the internal standard to obtain method accuracy. The method performance parameters, including overall recovery, intermediate precision, and measurement uncertainty, were evaluated on the basis of a nested design. The performance results were calculated by using a compiled SAS program that provided a semiautomated procedure for handling a large number of calculations in a few seconds. In general, the overall recoveries, for spiking levels of 10, 50, and 80 microg/kg, fell in a range of 81-110%, intermediate precisions were <20%, and measurement uncertainties were <40%.

After the whole trees were shaded with the sun-light about 50-55% for 20 days, AsA levels were significantly decreased in fruit peel, flesh and leaves, while mRNA expression levels and activities of L-galactose dehydrogenase (L-GalDH, EC 1.1.1.117) and L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (L-GalLDH, EC 1.3.2.3) as well as activities of recycling enzymes was clearly declined in the leaf and peel but not in the flesh. By shading fruits only for 20 days, AsA levels, relative mRNA levels and activities of L-GalDH and L-GalLDH as well as activities of recycling enzymes all showed obvious decrease in the peel, but not in the flesh. However, their levels in the peel were markedly increased after the full shade was removed and re-exposed these fruits on natural light for 5 days. It is concluded that light affects AsA biosynthesis and recycling in the peel and leaf, but did not in the fresh.

Patulin was separated within 5 min by high-performance liquid chromatography using a Synergi MAX-RP 80A column and water/acetonitrile (80/20, v/v) as the mobile phase. Electrospray ionization conditions in the negative ion mode were optimized for MS detection of patulin.

Disruption of both C. pomonella and G. molesta male orientation to pheromone traps in plots treated with a dual-species formulation (Isomate CM/OFM TT), simultaneously releasing the pheromone components of both C. pomonella and G. molesta, was equivalent to that obtained by treating plots with separate formulations for each species (Isomate C Plus or Isomate C TT for C. pomonella and Isomate M Rosso for G. molesta) through mid-season. However, disruption efficacy of the dual-species formulation was significantly lower near the end of the season for G. molesta compared with the Isomate M Rosso formulation because of depletion of active ingredients and coincided with a slight increase in fruit injury. Effective disruption of C. pomonella and G. molesta also was obtained with a multispecies formulation (Isomate CM/OFM/LR) that releases the main pheromone components of C. pomonella, G. molesta, and several leafroller species. Each formulation type releasing (E,E)-8,10-dodecadien-1-ol (codlemone) also was found to release the E,Z- and Z,E-isomers of codlemone. Our data provide further evidence that simultaneous disruption of C. pomonella and G. molesta with dispensers releasing both species' pheromone components is possible; however, the controlled release formulations tested here require modification or postponed deployment coupled with early season control by other means to achieve season-long efficacy.

19249817,"The pomegranate fruit ( Punica granatum ) has become an international high-value crop for the production of commercial pomegranate juice (PJ). The perceived consumer value of PJ is due in large part to its potential health benefits based on a significant body of medical research conducted with authentic PJ. To establish criteria for authenticating PJ, a new International Multidimensional Authenticity Specifications (IMAS) algorithm was developed through consideration of existing databases and comprehensive chemical characterization of 45 commercial juice samples from 23 different manufacturers in the United States. In addition to analysis of commercial juice samples obtained in the United States, data from other analyses of pomegranate juice and fruits including samples from Iran, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Syria, India, and China were considered in developing this protocol. There is universal agreement that the presence of a highly constant group of six anthocyanins together with punicalagins characterizes polyphenols in PJ. At a total sugar concentration of 16 degrees Brix, PJ contains characteristic sugars including mannitol at >0.3 g/100 mL. Ratios of glucose to mannitol of 4-15 and of glucose to fructose of 0.8-1.0 are also characteristic of PJ. In addition, no sucrose should be present because of isomerase activity during commercial processing. Stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry as > -25 per thousand assures that there is no added corn or cane sugar added to PJ. Sorbitol was present at <0.025 g/100 mL; maltose and tartaric acid were not detected. The presence of the amino acid proline at >25 mg/L is indicative of added grape products. Malic acid at >0.1 g/100 mL indicates adulteration with apple, pear, grape, cherry, plum, or aronia juice. Other adulteration methods include the addition of highly concentrated aronia, blueberry, or blackberry juices or natural grape pigments to poor-quality juices to imitate the color of pomegranate juice, which results in abnormal anthocyanin profiles. To adjust the astringent taste of poor-quality juice or peel extract, addition of nonpomegranate sugars is a commonly detected adulteration method. The profile generated from these analyses combined with information from existing databases and published literature has been integrated into a validated IMAS for PJ, which can be utilized to detect PJ adulteration.

19228034,"Ricin is a potent toxin capable of inhibiting protein synthesis and causing death or respiratory failure. Because of its high availability and lethality, ricin is considered a likely agent for bioterrorism. Rapidly determining contamination of food product with ricin and human exposure to ricin is therefore an important public health goal. In this work, we report the development of a method that detects ricin and its activity in food or clinical samples. This method involves immunocapture of the toxin, an examination of the activity of the ricin protein upon a DNA substrate that mimics the toxin's natural RNA target, and analysis of tryptic fragments of the toxin itself. It is the combination of these three techniques, all performed on the same sample, which allows for a sensitive and selective analysis of ricin isolated from a food or clinical sample.

19224664,"All aphid species studied so far share the same sex pheromone components, nepetalactol and nepetalactone. Variation by different enantiomers and blends of the two components released by different aphid species are limited and can only partially explain species-specific attraction of males to females. While some host-plant odours are known to enhance specific attraction of aphid species, herbivore-induced plant volatiles that synergise attractiveness to the sex pheromone are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that for the host-alternating rosy apple aphid (Dysaphis plantaginea (Passerini)) specificity of attraction of males to females is triggered by female-induced tree odours in combination with a 1:8 ratio of (4aS,7S,7aR)-nepetalactone and (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)-nepetalactol. Female aphid infestation induces increased release of four esters (hexyl butyrate, (E)-2-hexenyl butyrate, (Z)-3-hexenyl 3-methylbutyrate and hexyl 2-methylbutyrate) from apple leaves. Two different combinations of three esters applied in a 1:1:1 ratio increase the number of male D. plantaginea and decrease the number of other aphid species caught in water traps in the presence of the pheromone components. The ester blend alone was not attractive. Combination of the pheromone blend with each single ester was not increasing attraction of male D. plantaginea.

Two methods of separation and purification of polyphenols from apple pomace extract were established by combination of gel chromatography with high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) and solvent extraction with HSCCC, respectively. The optimal separation was performed on a Sephadex LH-20 column using gradient aqueous ethanol as eluting solvent from 0% to 100% in increments of 10%. HPLC analysis indicated that main polyphenols existed in fractions eluted between 40% and 50% aqueous ethanol. The fractions of interest from column were separated by HSCCC with the solvent system hexane-ethyl acetate-1% aqueous acetic acid (0.5:9.5:10, v/v/v). Ethyl acetate fractionation of the apple pomace extract followed by direct HSCCC separation by the same solvent system in the volume ratio of 1:9:10 also produced a good separation of the main polyphenols of interest.

To investigate the metabolism and bioavailability of these compounds, nine healthy and five ileostomy human subjects consumed 500 mL of Thatchers Redstreak apple cider containing 46 micromol of phloretin-O-glycosides. Over the ensuing 24 h period, plasma, urine, and ileal fluid were collected prior to analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The sole metabolite present in quantifiable amounts in plasma was phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, which reached a peak concentration (C(max)) of 73 nmol/L and 0.6 h after ingestion (T(max)) with the healthy subjects, and statistically similar values were obtained with the ileostomy volunteers. Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide was also detected in urine along with two additional phloretin-O-glucuronides and a phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate. The quantity of phloretin metabolites excreted in urine represented 5.0 + or - 0.9% of intake in healthy volunteers and 5.5 + or - 0.6% in ileostomy volunteers. The similarity in the excretion levels of the two groups and the rapid plasma T(max) indicate absorption of the dihydrochalcones in the small intestine. Of the two major phloretin-O-glycosides in cider, only phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside was recovered in ileal fluid in quantities corresponding to 22% of intake. The absence of phloretin-2'-O-glucoside in ileal fluid suggests that it is more readily absorbed than phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside. Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, two other phloretin-O-glucuronides, one phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate, two phloretin-O-sulfates, and the aglycone phloretin were also detected in the ileal fluid. This implies that the wall of the small intestine contains beta-glycosidase, sulfuryltransferase, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities and that, as well as being absorbed, sizable amounts of the phloretin metabolites that are formed efflux back into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract.

19166386,"Many pharmaceutical drugs arc isolated from plants used in traditional medicines, and new plant-derived pharmaceutical drugs continue to be identified. Relevant to this review, different plant-derived agonists for gammadelta T cells are described that impart effector functions upon distinct subsets of these cells. Recently, plant tannins have been defined as one class of gammadelta T cell agonist and appear to preferentially activate the mucosal population. Mucosal gammadelta T cells function to modulate tissue immune responses and induce epithelium repair. Select tannins, isolated from apple peel, rapidly induce immune gene transcription in gammadelta T cells, leading to cytokinc production and increased responsiveness to secondary signals. Activity of these tannin preparations tracks to the procyanidin fraction, with the procyanidin trimer (C1) having the most robust activity defined to date.

FODMAPs include lactose, fructose in excess of glucose, fructans and fructooligosaccharides (FOS, nystose, kestose), galactooligosaccharides (GOS, raffinose, stachyose), and sugar polyols (sorbitol, mannitol). This paper describes an analytical approach based on HPLC with ELSD that quantifies the major FODMAPs in 45 vegetables and 41 fruits. Sorbitol and/or mannitol were measured in 18 vegetables (range = 0.09-2.96 g/100 g of fw), raffinose and/or stachyose in 7 vegetables (0.08-0.68 g/100 g of fw), and nystose and/or kestose in 19 vegetables (0.02-0.71 g/100 g of fw). Apple, pear, mango, clingstone peach, and watermelon all contained fructose in excess of glucose. Sorbitol was measured in 15 fruits (0.53-5.99 g/100 g of fw), mannitol was found in 2 fruits, and nystose or kestose was measured in 8 fruits.

20361559,"Fruits and vegetables are essential sources of many nutritive substances which are necessary for normal function of the organism. One of the mostly consumed fruits in many European countries, including Poland is apples. The prohealthy properties of apples are associated with the contents of polyphenolic compounds, thus including in parts phenolic acids which have antioxidant properties. The concentration of these compounds depends on many factors such as variety climate and soil conditions, maturity as well as agro technical operations. The aim of this investigation was to compare the concentrations of phenolic acids and epicatechin in the varieties of apple Champion and Jonica, which were collected from different orchards around Lublin. The phenolic compounds were assayed using a Symmetry column carrier RP-C18 (Waters) integrated with a high pressure liquid chromatography apparatus. The dominant phenolic acids found in the Champion variety was chlorogenic acid, whereas in the Jonica variety, chlorogenic and homovanilic acids were the dominate once. The highest concentrations of chlorogenic acid was detected in the pulp of an apple (Jonica variety) collected from the orchards around the cities of Puławy and Lublin, whereas homovanilic acid was the highest in the other samples collected from the orchards in the vicinity of Stryjno and Góry Markuszowskie. Among the Jonica and Champion varieties of apples collected from various orchards in the vicinity of Lublin, the highest content of epicatechin (13,12 mg/kg) was found in the pulps of Champions variety collected in Puławy.

Limited sequence similarity with juvenile hormone-binding proteins (JHBPs), which specifically bind and transport juvenile hormones in Lepidoptera, suggested a role for To proteins in binding hydrophobic ligands. We present the first crystal structure of a To protein, EpTo1 from the light brown apple moth Epiphyas postvittana, solved in-house by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction technique using sulfur anomalous dispersion, and refined to 1.3 angstroms resolution. EpTo1 adopts the unusual alpha/beta-wrap fold, seen only for JHBP and several mammalian lipid carrier proteins, a scaffold tailored for the binding and/or transport of hydrophobic ligands. EpTo1 has a 45 angstroms long, purely hydrophobic, internal tunnel that extends for the full length of the protein and accommodates a bound ligand. The latter was shown by mass spectrometry to be ubiquinone-8 and is probably derived from Escherichia coli.

To assess the activity of apple (Malus domestica) pollen TGase on the functional properties of actin and tubulin, TGase was prepared from apple pollen by hydrophobic- interaction chromatography and assayed on actin and tubulin purified from the same cell type. The enzyme catalysed the incorporation of putrescine into the cytoskeleton monomers. When tested on actin filaments, pollen TGase induced the formation of high-molecular-mass aggregates of actin. Use of fluorescein-cadaverine showed that the labelled polyamine was incorporated into actin by pollen TGase, similar to with guinea pig liver TGase. The pollen TGase also reduced the enzyme activity and the binding of myosin to TGase-treated actin filaments. Polymerization of tubulin in the presence of pollen TGase also yielded the formation of high-molecular-mass aggregates. Furthermore, the pollen TGase also affected the binding of kinesin to microtubules and reduced the motility of microtubules along kinesin-coated slides.

27873917,"Vitamin C (ascorbic acid, ascorbate, AA) is a water soluble organic compound that participates in many biological processes. The main aim of this paper was to utilize two electrochemical detectors (amperometric - Coulouchem III and coulometric - CoulArray) coupled with flow injection analysis for the detection of ascorbic acid. Primarily, we optimized the experimental conditions. The optimized conditions were as follows: detector potential 100 mV, temperature 25 °C, mobile phase 0.09% TFA:ACN, 3:97 (v/v) and flow rate 0.13 mL·min-1. The tangents of the calibration curves were 0.3788 for the coulometric method and 0.0136 for the amperometric one. The tangent of the calibration curve measured by the coulometric detector was almost 30 times higher than the tangent measured by the amperometric detector. Consequently, we coupled a CoulArray electrochemical detector with high performance liquid chromatography and estimated the detection limit for AA as 90 nM (450 fmol per 5 μL injection). The method was used for the determination of vitamin C in a pharmaceutical preparations (98 ± 2 mg per tablet), in oranges (Citrus aurantium) (varied from 30 to 56 mg/100 g fresh weight), in apples (Malus sp.) (varied from 11 to 19 mg/100 g fresh weight), and in human blood serum (varied from 38 to 78 μM).

18943357,"ABSTRACT Contamination of apples (Malus domestica) and derived juices with fungicide residues and patulin produced by Penicillium expansum are major issues of food safety. Biocontrol agents represent an alternative or supplement to chemicals for disease control. Our data show that these microbes could also contribute to actively decreasing patulin accumulation in apples. Three biocontrol agents, Rhodotorula glutinis LS11, Cryptococcus laurentii LS28, and Aureobasidium pullulans LS30, were examined for their in vitro growth in the presence of patulin and for their capability to decrease mycotoxin recovery from the medium. Strain LS11 yielded the highest growth rates and the greatest decrease of toxin recoveries. Further, it caused the appearance of two major spots on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates, suggesting possible metabolization of the mycotoxin. In vivo, i.e., in the low percentage of LS11-pretreated apples infected by P. expansum, patulin accumulation was significantly lower than in nontreated infected fruits. Yeast cells survived and increased in infected apples and, in a model system emulating decaying apple, resulted in accelerated breakdown of patulin and the production of the same TLC spots as those detected in vitro. These data suggest that biocontrol yeast cells surviving in decaying apples could metabolize patulin and/or negatively affect its accumulation or synthesis. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the effect of a biocontrol agent on patulin accumulation in vivo.",Phytopathology,[],[],Effect of the Biocontrol Yeast Rhodotorula glutinis Strain LS11 on Patulin Accumulation in Stored Apples.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18943357,2012,0,0,yeast to reduce PAT production,apple,0.10975609756097561,"['fungicide', 'Penicillium expansum', 'patulin']",1,9

When coupled to analysis via micellar EKC (MEKC), the total analysis time per sample was less than 15 min for the water and juice samples and less than 20 min for the milk. The SPE process allowed for anywhere from a three to a fourteen-fold improvement in the LOD for each alkaloid when compared to detecting the alkaloids in a nontreated water sample matrix. Following SPE, the LODs for colchicine, strychnine, and nicotine were sufficient to meet levels from 150 to 5000 times more dilute than the LD(50) for a 50 kg individual drinking 12 oz of a contaminated beverage. Aconitine, on the other hand, was detected at approximately the LD(50) level. The percent recoveries for the SPE ranged from 37% to as high as 99%.

18774823,"Reactive dicarbonyl species, such as methylglyoxal (MGO) and glyoxal (GO), have received extensive attention recently due to their high reactivity and ability to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs) with biological substances such as proteins, phospholipids, and DNA. In the present study, we found that both phloretin and its glucoside, phloridzin, the major bioactive apple polyphenols, could efficiently trap reactive MGO or GO to form mono- and di-MGO or GO adducts under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37 degrees C). More than 80% MGO was trapped within 10 min, and 68% GO was trapped within 24 h by phloretin. Phloridzin also had strong trapping efficiency by quenching more than 70% MGO and 60% GO within 24 h. The glucosylation of the hydroxyl group at position 2 could significantly slow down the trapping rate and the formation of MGO or GO adducts. The products formed from phloretin (or phloridzin) and MGO (or GO), combined at different ratios, were analyzed using LC/MS. We successfully purified the major mono-MGO adduct of phloridzin and found that it was a mixture of tautomers based on the one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra. Our LC/MS and NMR data showed that positions 3 and 5 of the phloretin or phloridzin A ring were the major active sites for trapping reactive dicarbonyl species. We also found that phloretin was more reactive than lysine and arginine in terms of trapping reactive dicarbonyl species, MGO or GO.

Patulin and citrinin were produced by 90% (36) and 80% (32) of the 40 strains, indicating that P. expansum is a consistent producer of these mycotoxins. The patulin content in the extracts was substantially higher than the citrinin content. Other mycotoxins whose production in pure culture has been reported were simultaneously detected with high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis with the positive ion mode of electrospray ionization.

Best limits of determination (LODs) of pesticides in the fruit juices were achieved for metolcarb (1 microg/L in apple juice), carbofuran and dinoseb (2 microg/L in apple juice); for the analysis of apple skin best LODs were 10 pg/cm(2) of atrazine, metolcarb and propoxur which corresponds to an estimated concentration of 0.01 microg/kg apple, taking into account the surface area and the weight of the apple. The measured LODs were within or below the allowed maximum residue levels (MRLs) decreed by the European Union (1-500 microg/kg for pesticides in fruit juice and 0.01-5 microg/kg for apple skin). No sample pretreatment (extraction, pre-concentration, chromatographic separation) was necessary to analyze these pesticides by direct desorption/ionization using APGD-MS and to identify them using MS/MS.

18683822,"Epidemiological studies have shown that the risk of developing oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OA) is inversely correlated to consumption of fruits and vegetables. Flavan-3-ols are the most abundant subclass of flavonoids in these types of foods. Three apple-derived procyanidin fractions with different average degrees of polymerization (aDP) were characterized and the effects of these fractions and of pure flavan-3-ol monomers ((-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin) and dimers (B1, B2) on two OA cell lines were investigated. Flavan-3-ol monomers and dimers had no effect on the two cell lines, while apple-derived flavan-3-ol oligomers and polymers induced a time-dependent reduction of cell viability. The reduction in the cell viability was due to the induction of caspase-mediated apoptosis and an arrest of the cell cycle in G0/G1. The magnitude of the reduction in cell viability and induction of apoptosis after exposure to flavan-3-ol oligomeric/polymeric fractions positively correlated with their aDP. These results indicate that only flavan-3-ol oligomers and polymers, but not monomers and dimers, have an effect on the proliferation of OA cells in vitro.

The minimum fluorescence values produced by both fluorometer types in response to a reversible low-oxygen stress in apples were indistinguishable: both Fo and Falpha increased when O2 levels were lowered below the anaerobic compensation point (ACP); when gas levels returned to normoxia both parameters dipped below, then returned to, the original fluorescence baseline. The two parameters also responded similarly to the irreversible osmotic stress in grapes: in both cultivars, Falpha and Fo first decreased before reaching an inflection point at approximately 20% mass loss and then increased towards a second inflection point. However, the two parameters were not analogous under the irreversible osmotic stress; most notably, the relative Falpha values appeared to be lower than Fo during the later stages of dehydration. This was likely due to the influence of the Fm parameter and an overestimation of Falpha when measuring the fluorescence from healthy and responsive chloroplasts as found in grapes experiencing minimal water loss, but not in grapes undergoing moderate to severe dehydration.

Although no apple-fruity volatile esters were detected in transgenic tobacco leaves, methyl caprylate, methyl caprate, and methyl dodecanoate were newly generated, and the concentrations of methyl benzoate and methyl tetradecanoate were significantly increased, suggesting that MdAAT2 may use medium-chain fatty acyl CoA and benzoyl-CoA as acyl donors together with methanol acceptors as substrates. Surprisingly, the concentrations of linalool were significantly increased in transgenic tobacco leaves, which may mediate the repellent effect on Myzus persicae (Sulzer) aphids. Using methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and wounding treatments, we found that MdAAT2 may substitute for the partial ability of MeJA to induce the production of linalool in transgenic plants.

18620809,"A separation/preconcentration procedure using solid phase extraction has been proposed for the flame atomic absorption spectrometric determination of copper and nickel at trace level in food samples. The solid phase is Dowex Optipore SD-2 resin contained on a minicolumn, where analyte ions are sorbed as 5-methyl-4-(2-thiazolylazo) resorcinol chelates. After elution using 1 mol L(-1) nitric acid solution, the analytes are determinate employing flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The optimization step was performed using a full two-level factorial design and the variables studied were: pH, reagent concentration (RC) and amount of resin on the column (AR). Under the experimental conditions established in the optimization step, the procedure allows the determination of copper and nickel with limit of detection of 1.03 and 1.90 microg L(-1), respectively and precision of 7 and 8%, for concentrations of copper and nickel of 200 microg L(-1). The effect of matrix ions was also evaluated.

18611028,"There is considerable evidence to show that a greater intake of apple contributes to improved health by reducing the risk of diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and some forms of cancer. Apple fruit is a major source of phenol compounds, because its consumption is widespread in many countries and it is available on the market for the whole year. The phenolic composition of 67 varieties of apple cultivars (new and old varieties) was examined for the concentration of some important phytochemicals and antioxidant activity. For the first time, we have looked at the correlation and compared polyphenolic coumpounds in Golden Delicious variety and new varieties grown from it. Up to 18 compounds, including catechin, procyanidin, hydroxycinnamates, flavonols, anthocyanins, and dihydrochalcones, were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection analysis of crude extracts and after thiolysis and LC-MS. The mean content of total polyphenols lay between 523.02 and 2723.96 mg/100 g dw and depending upon the apples variety. Flavanols (catechin and oligomeric procyanidins) are the major class of apple polyphenols, representing more than 80%, followed by hydroxycinnamic acids (1-31%), flavonols (2-10%), dihydrochalcones (0.5-5%), and in red apples, anthocyanins (1%). In this study, the best correlation was found for the total polyphenols and ABTS method, with a lower correlation for FRAP and DPPH methods ( r = 0.871, 0.839, and 0.804, respectively).

Apple trees infected by this phytoplasma emitted higher amounts of beta-caryophyllene when compared to uninfected ones. Psyllids that had no previous contact with Ca.

18441012,"Coagulation factor XI (FXI) is a covalent homodimer consisting of two identical subunits of 80 kDa linked by a disulfide bond formed by Cys-321 within the Apple 4 domain of each subunit. Because FXI(C321S) is a noncovalent dimer, residues within the interface between the two subunits must mediate its homodimeric structure. The crystal structure of FXI demonstrates formation of salt bridges between Lys-331 of one subunit and Glu-287 of the other subunit and hydrophobic interactions at the interface of the Apple 4 domains involving Ile-290, Leu-284, and Tyr-329. FXI(C321S), FXI(C321S,K331A), FXI(C321S,E287A), FXI(C321S,I290A), FXI(C321S,Y329A), FXI(C321S,L284A), FXI(C321S,K331R), and FXI(C321S,H343A) were expressed in HEK293 cells and characterized using size exclusion chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, electron microscopy, and functional assays. Whereas FXI(C321S) and FXI(C321S,H343A) existed in monomer/dimer equilibrium (K(d) approximately 40 nm), all other mutants were predominantly monomers with impaired dimer formation by analytical ultracentrifugation (K(d)=3-38 microm). When converted to the active enzyme, FXIa, all the monomeric mutants activated FIX similarly to wild-type dimeric FXIa.

18430505,"A microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography (MEECK) method for patulin (PAT) quantification in apple juice samples has been developed. The effects of several important factors such as co-surfactant type, concentration of surfactant, acetonitrile percentage in the microemulsion, and running voltage and temperature were investigated to determine the optimum conditions. They resulted to be: a background electrolyte (BGE) composed of 25mM of sodium tetraborate, SDS (2.16%w/w), ethanol (6.49%w/w), n-octanol (0.82%w/w) and 2%v/v acetonitrile; applied voltage of +15kV; and a capillary temperature of 35 degrees C. PAT was detected at 276nm. Quantification and detection limits (LOQ and LOD) in apple juice samples were 8.0microgL(-1) and 3.2microgL(-1), respectively. Patulin was extracted from apple juice using ethyl acetate with a mean recovery value of 75.3% (RSD=4.5). This method was applied to the measurement of patulin in twenty commercial apple juice samples obtained from different Danish supermarkets. The PAT apple juice mean and median levels obtained were 35.9 and 10.9microgL(-1), respectively. The comparison with a previously validated micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) method for PAT analysis showed the suitability of using MEEKC for this mycotoxin analysis.

18425747,"As pectin molecules are too large and heterogeneous to analyze as a whole, the polymer is usually degraded to smaller oligomers, which are often analyzed by high-performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC). However, the high salt concentration necessary to elute pectin oligomers by HPAEC is incompatible with online mass detection. To overcome such a disadvantage, a CE-IT-MS system was set up to further elucidate the fine structure of charged oligosaccharides. An effective separation of differently substituted galacturonic acid containing oligomers was obtained by low-pH CE-LIF analysis. By adapting the buffer and capillary online MS detection was enabled. Moreover, with MS/MS it was possible to localize sugar residues' substitutions. With this combined CE-MS approach LIF electropherograms of xylogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan I digests could be annotated.

These test systems measured antioxidant effects, modulation of carcinogen metabolism, anti-inflammatory and antihormonal activities, and antiproliferative potential. Regression analyses indicated that 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging potential correlated with the sum of low molecular weight (LMW) antioxidants (including chlorogenic acid, flavan-3-ols, and flavonols) and procyanidins, whereas peroxyl radicals were more effectively scavenged by LMW compounds than by procyanidins.

18310924,"Chronic marginal periodontitis is a destructive inflammatory disease caused by an imbalance between bacterial virulence and host defense ability, resulting in eventual tooth exfoliation. Porphyromonas gingivalis, a major periodontal pathogen, triggers a series of cellular inflammatory responses including the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which causes periodontal destruction; thus, anti-inflammatory reagents are considered beneficial for periodontal therapy. In the present study, we examined whether hop- and apple-derived polyphenols (HBP and ACT, respectively) inhibit PGE2 production by human gingival epithelial (HGE) cells stimulated with P. gingivalis components. HGE cells were stimulated with P. gingivalis membrane vesicles, and the effects of HBP, ACT and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) on PGE2 production by HGE cells were evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HBP and EGCg significantly inhibited PGE2 production, whereas ACT did not. By further fractionation steps of HBP to identify the effective components, 3 components of HBP, 2-[(2-methylpropanoyl)-phloroglucinol]1-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (MPPG), quercetin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (isoquercitrin), and kaempferol 3-O-beta-glucopyranoside (astragalin), were found to be elements which significantly inhibited cellular PGE2 production.

18275458,"Fire blight is a disease affecting Maloideae caused by the necrogenic bacterium Erwinia amylovora, which requires the type III protein secretion system (TTSS) for pathogenicity. Profiles of methanol-extractable leaf phenolics of two apple (Malus x domestica) genotypes with contrasting susceptibility to this disease were analyzed by HPLC after infection. Some qualitative differences were recorded between the constitutive compositions of the two genotypes but in both of them dihydrochalcones accounted for more than 90% of total phenolics. Principal component analysis separated leaves inoculated with a virulent wild-type strain from those inoculated with a non-pathogenic TTSS-defective mutant or with water. The changes in levels of the various groups of phenolics in response to the virulent bacterium were similar between the two genotypes, with a significant decrease of dihydrochalcones and a significant increase of hydroxycinnamate derivatives. Differences between genotypes were, however, recorded in amplitude and kinetic of variation in these groups. Occurrence of oxidation and polymerization reactions is proposed, based on the browning process of infected tissues, but whether some by-products act in defense as toxic compounds remain to be tested. Among direct antibacterial constitutive compounds present in apple leaves, the dihydrochalcone phloretin only was found at levels close to lethal concentrations in both genotypes.

18256050,"Whole apple fruit (Malus domestica Borkh.) widely differing in pigment content and composition has been examined by recording its chlorophyll fluorescence excitation and diffuse reflection spectra in the visible and near UV regions. Spectral bands sensitive to the pigment concentration have been identified, and linear models for non-destructive assessment of anthocyanins, carotenoids, and flavonols via chlorophyll fluorescence measurements are put forward. The adaptation of apple fruit to high light stress involves accumulation of these protective pigments, which absorb solar radiation in broad spectral ranges extending from UV to the green and, in anthocyanin-containing cultivars, to the red regions of the spectrum. In ripening apples the protective effect in the blue region could be attributed to extrathylakoid carotenoids. A simple model, which allows the simulation of chlorophyll fluorescence excitation spectra in the visible range and a quantitative evaluation of competitive absorption by anthocyanins, carotenoids, and flavonols, is described. Evidence is presented to support the view that anthocyanins, carotenoids, and flavonols play, in fruit with low-to-moderate pigment content, the role of internal traps (insofar as they compete with chlorophylls for the absorption of incident light in specific spectral bands), affecting thereby the shape of the chlorophyll fluorescence excitation spectrum.",Journal of experimental botany,"['D000872', 'D002338', 'D002734', 'D044948', 'D005638', 'D027845', 'D008956', 'D013050', 'D013472']","['Anthocyanins', 'Carotenoids', 'Chlorophyll', 'Flavonols', 'Fruit', 'Malus', 'Models, Chemical', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Sunlight']","Effect of anthocyanins, carotenoids, and flavonols on chlorophyll fluorescence excitation spectra in apple fruit: signature analysis, assessment, modelling, and relevance to photoprotection.","['Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None]","['analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18256050,2008,1,1,"Flavonols, chlorophyll, carotenoids",apple,0.22727272727272727,"['anthocyanins', 'carotenoids', 'Malus domestica Borkh', 'chlorophyll', 'flavonols']",1,15

In a model system at pH 7.0, the formation of covalent addition products was demonstrated for both derivatives. The addition product of CQA dimer and tert-butyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine was characterized by LC/MS(n) as a benzacridine structure. For N-acetyl-L-cysteine, mono- and diaddition products at the thiol group with CQA quinone were found. In apple juice at pH 3.6, covalent interactions of CQA quinone were observed only with N-acetyl-L-cysteine.

Their autumnal fruits are consumed worldwide in different forms, that is, fresh or transformed into jams, jelly, juices, etc. Their well-established beneficial properties to human health were found mainly related to their phenolic content. Pulp and peel aqueous acetone extracts obtained from Tunisian fruits at commercial maturity were comparatively evaluated for their phenolic profiles and antioxidant and antimicrobial potentials. The phenolic compounds present in the extracts were identified and quantified using RP-HPLC-DAD and ESI-MS techniques. Significant differences in the chromatographic profiles among these fruits, as well as between pulp and peel extracts of each fruit, were observed. Quince, followed by 'Red Delicious', peel extracts showed the highest phenolic content (160.33 and 110.90 mg/100 g of fresh weight). The stronger inhibitory effect on DPPH radicals corresponded to those obtained from peel materials. A comparative analysis of the antimicrobial potential against a range of microorganism strains was also carried out. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus were the most sensitive to the active extracts. Among the examined phenolic extracts, 'Red Delicious' and quince peels showed the highest effects for inhibiting bacteria growth.

The oxidation products were characterised by RP-HPLC coupled with electrospray ionisation Mass spectrometry (MS). The reactivities of the A- and B-rings were clearly different on the basis of the oxidation products formed. Both A- and B-rings could be involved in covalent bond formation, but electron transfers only occurred with the B-ring. Most of the (-)-epicatechin oxidation products were linked by A/B-ring linkage (""head-to-tail"" intermolecular coupling).

18055622,"Insect communication is primarily via chemicals. In Aphidinae aphids, the structure and ratio of iridoid (monoterpenoid) chemicals are known to be important components of the sex pheromone. However, for enhanced species specificity, it has been suggested that release of sex pheromone might be restricted to a narrow time period within the diel cycle. Here, we determine the structure, ratios and release patterns of iridoid chemicals produced by a serious global pest, the rosy apple aphid, Dysaphis plantaginea. Volatiles were collected from batches of oviparae (sexual females) and chemicals identified by gas chromatography, mass-spectrometry and microscale NMR spectroscopy. (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)-Nepetalactol and (4aS,7S,7aR)-nepetalactone were detected in a 3.7:1 ratio. To investigate timing of release, we constructed a sequential sampling device that allowed volatile chemicals to be captured hourly from 95 same-aged oviparae over 20 consecutive days. Release patterns of the two sex pheromone components show that D. plantaginea oviparae release high levels of the two components during photophase and low levels during scotophase. Release of the two components increased significantly during the first 3 h of photophase and thereafter remained at a high level until the onset of scotophase. The ratio of (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)-nepetalactol to (4aS,7S,7aR)-nepetalactone released did not change significantly between days two to 14 of the adult stadium, but from the 15th day onward there was a significant decrease in the relative amount of (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)-nepetalactol. Pheromone release was greatest on the eighth day of the adult stadium, with up to 8.4 ng of pheromone released per ovipara per hour. This is the first report on the full structural identification and ratios of volatile iridoid components collected from D. plantaginea oviparae and is also the most detailed temporal study on sex pheromone release from any aphid species. The lack of a temporally narrow and distinct period of very high sex pheromone release suggests that alternative mechanisms or factors for species recognition and isolation may be important.

18052096,"A recently developed spectrophotometric assay for the detection of organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides by means of cutinase inhibition has been successfully extended to two esterases derived from Bacillus subtilis (BS2) and rabbit liver. These esterases were selected because of their high sensitivity to the examined insecticide classes and their pronounced inhibition profile. With inhibition constants (ki) of 2.0x10(7) and 2.6x10(6) L/(mol.min) for rabbit liver esterase and BS2, respectively, chlorpyrifos oxon proved to be the strongest inhibitor directly followed by paraoxon. As compared to choline esterases and the recently studied cutinase, both esterases are surprisingly strongly inhibited by organophosphorus thions, showing k i in the range of 5.3x10(2) to 2.3x10(4) L/(mol.min). All tested insecticidal carbamates were also inhibitors of BS2 and rabbit liver esterase, albeit in a rather uniform manner. Generally, both enzymes were found to be about 2 orders of magnitude more sensitive on the studied insecticides than cutinase even with an enhanced sensitivity against plant matrix effects.

Present in a wide range of vegetables and fruits, flavonoids form an integral part of the human diet and confer multiple health benefits. Here, we report on metabolic engineering of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathways in apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) by overexpression of the maize (Zea mays L.) leaf colour (Lc) regulatory gene. The Lc gene was transferred into the M. domestica cultivar Holsteiner Cox via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation which resulted in enhanced anthocyanin accumulation in regenerated shoots. Five independent Lc lines were investigated for integration of Lc into the plant genome by Southern blot and PCR analyses. The Lc-transgenic lines contained one or two Lc gene copies and showed increased mRNA levels for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), chalcone synthase (CHS), flavanone 3 beta-hydroxylase (FHT), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), leucoanthocyanidin reductases (LAR), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) and anthocyanidin reductase (ANR). HPLC-DAD and LC-MS analyses revealed higher levels of the anthocyanin idaein (12-fold), the flavan 3-ol epicatechin (14-fold), and especially the isomeric catechin (41-fold), and some distinct dimeric proanthocyanidins (7 to 134-fold) in leaf tissues of Lc-transgenic lines.

In this study, the effect of three different diets - normal piglets starter without additives, with apple pomace or with red-wine pomace - on the intestinal morphology was investigated from 3 days prior to weaning to 4 weeks post-weaning. At five time points, six piglets from each treatment group were slaughtered; at first time point only six animals from control group were slaughtered. Villus height, crypt depth and breadth of villi and crypts were determined in the jejunum, ileum and colon in 78 piglets. Additionally, the area of the Peyer's patches in the ileum was measured. In jejunum (p < 0.01) and ileum (p < 0.001) the villus length in the control group decreased after weaning but increased over the entire feeding experiment (p < 0.001). In the two-pomace groups, no decrease was measured after weaning. In jejunum, an increase in villi breadth occurred, 73% in the control group and approximately 10% in both treatment groups. A 35% increase was found in the ileum in all groups. Peyer's patches area increased approximately 21% in the control group over 26 days of treatment, whereas in other groups no significant differences were found. Different polyphenol rich pomaces have diverse effects in the gastrointestinal tract. Red-wine pomace has an inhibitory effect on the jejunum villi growth, whereas apple and red-wine pomace have stimulating effect on crypt size in piglet colon.

To gain insight into the aroma compounds responsible for such odor changes, a comparative aroma extract dilution analysis was applied on unstored, raw Arabica coffee beans from Colombia (water content=11.75%) and on the same beans with a water content of 13.5%, which were stored for 9 months at 40 degrees C. In combination with the flavor dilution (FD) factors, the results of the identification experiments showed strong increases in (E)-beta-damascenone (cooked apple-like), 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (clove-like), and methyl 2-methyl- and methyl 3-methylbutanoate (fruity), whereas others, such as the earthy smelling 3-isopropyl-2-methoxypyrazine as well as 2-phenylethanol and 3-methoxyphenol, remained unchanged during storage. In addition, the previously unknown coffee odorant 2-methoxy-5-vinylphenol (intense smoky odor) increased significantly during storage. Quantitative measurements performed on raw coffee samples stored at various temperatures, water contents, and oxygen availabilities indicated that the significant increase of, in particular, the methyl esters of 2- and 3-methylbutanoic acid were responsible for the pronounced and fruity odor quality perceived in the stored green coffee, whereas the higher concentrations of 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol and 2-methoxy-5-vinylphenol led to the more pronounced smoky, clove-like odor quality.

17551990,"A liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-TOFMS) method has been developed for the determination of 12 pesticides (namely, carbendazim, thiabendazole, imazalil, tridemorph, triadimefon, bitertanol, prochloraz, flutriafol, myclobutanil, iprodione, diphenylamine and procymidone) in fruit-based baby food (multi-fruit jars and juices intended for infant consumption). The developed method consists of a sample treatment step based on liquid-liquid extraction using acetonitrile, followed by a clean-up step based on dispersive solid-phase extraction (SPE) with a primary-secondary amine (PSA). Multi-fruit and apple juices were processed by a SPE procedure using Oasis HLB cartridges. Subsequent identification and quantitation was accomplished by LC/ESI-TOFMS analysis: the confirmation of the target pesticides was based on accurate mass measurements of selected ions (protonated molecules ([M+H]+) and fragment ions). Confirmation studies were accomplished at low concentration levels (10 microg kg-1) and accuracy errors lower than 2 ppm were obtained in most cases. Baby food extracts spiked at 10 microg kg-1 fortification level yielded average recoveries in the range 78-105% with relative standard deviations less than 10% for most of the analytes. Limits of detection (LODs) were between 0.1 and 4 microg kg-1 depending on the pesticide studied. Finally, the proposed method was applied to a total of 33 baby food samples from Spain and the United Kingdom.

17549601,"An apple spermidine synthase (SPDS) gene (MdSPDS1) was verified to encode a functional protein by the complementation of the spe3 yeast mutant, which lacks the SPDS gene. To justify our hypothesis that apple SPDS is involved in abiotic stress responses and to obtain transgenic fruit trees tolerant to abiotic stresses as well, MdSPDS1-over-expressing transgenic European pear (Pyrus communis L. 'Ballad') plants were created by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. A total of 21 transgenic lines showing various spermidine (Spd) titers and MdSPDS1 expression levels were obtained. Selected lines were exposed to salt (150 mM NaCl), osmosis (300 mM mannitol), and heavy metal (500 microM CuSO4) stresses for evaluating their stress tolerances. Transgenic line no. 32, which was revealed to have the highest Spd accumulation and expression level of MdSPDS1, showed the strongest tolerance to these stresses. When growth increments, electrolyte leakage (EL), and values of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were monitored, line no. 32 showed the lowest growth inhibition and the least increase in EL or TBARS under stress conditions. Spd titers in wild-type and transgenic lines showed diverse changes upon stresses, and these changes were not consistent with the changes in MdSPDS1 expressions. Moreover, there were no differences in the sodium concentration in the shoots between the wild type and line no. 32, whereas the copper concentration was higher in the wild type than in line no. 32. Although the mechanism(s) underlying the involvement of polyamines in stress responses is not known, these results suggest that the over-expression of the SPDS gene substantially increased the tolerance to multiple stresses by altering the polyamine titers in pear.

The analytical procedure involves an extraction with acetone and liquid-liquid partitioning with ethyl acetate/cyclohexane combined in one step. The extracts are analyzed by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) without any further clean-up step. The pesticides are separated on a reversed-phase C12 column using a gradient elution. Thirteen simultaneous MS/MS transitions of precursor ions were monitored.

The results indicated that the values of similarity coefficient concerning volatile types between the two species were in accordance with the evolution of M. pumila cultivars (forms), and that M. sieversii seedlings showed considerable genetic variations in these aspects: the total content of volatile components, the classes and contents of each compound classes, the segregation ratio, and content of main components. The results showed significant difference among seedlings and wide genetic diversity within the populations. Comparison of the volatile components in M. sieversii with those in M. pumila cultivars showed that the common compounds whose number were larger than five with the contents over 0.04 mg/L simultaneously between M. sieversii and M. pumila cultivars belonged to esters, alcohols, aldehydes or ketones. This suggests fundamental identity in main volatile components of M. sieversii and M. pumila cultivars. The results above sustained the conclusion ""M. sieversii is probably the ancestor of M. pumila"". However, there were 48 compounds present in M. pumila that were not detected in M. sieversii, including 6 character impact components (i.e., propyl acetate, (Z)-3-hexenal, 2-methyl-1-butanol acetate, pentyl acetate, 3-furanmethanol, and benzene acetaldehyde).

The plant species used were: basil (Ocimum selloi Benth.), rue (Ruta graveolens L.), lion's ear (Leonotis nepetaefolia L.), Jimson weed (Datura stramonium L.), 'baleeira' herb (Cordia verbenaceae L.), mint (Mentha piperita L.), wild balsam apple (Mormodica charantia L.) and billy goat weed (Ageratum conyzoides L.). Firstly, the insecticidal activities of hexane and ethanol plant extracts were evaluated against adults of R. dominica. Among them, only the hexane extract of A. conyzoides showed insecticidal activity. The hexane extract of this plant species was therefore fractionated by silica gel column chromatography to isolate and purify its bioactive chemical constituents. Three compounds were identified using IR spectra, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, HMBC and NOE after gel chromatography: 5,6,7,8,3', 4', 5'-heptamethoxyflavone, 5,6,7,8,3'-pentamethoxy-4', 5'-methylenedioxyflavone and coumarin. The complete assignment of (13)C NMR to 5,6,7,8,3'-pentamethoxy-4', 5'-methylenedioxyflavone was successfully made for the first time. 5,6,7,8,3'-Pentamethoxy-4', 5'-methylenedioxyflavone did not show any insecticidal activity against the four insect species tested. 5,6,7,8,3', 4', 5'-Heptamethoxyflavone showed low activity against D. hyalinata and R. dominica and was not toxic to M. domestica or P. americana. In contrast, coumarin showed insecticidal activity against all four insect pest species tested, with the following order of susceptibility: R. dominica < P. americana < D. hyalinata < M. domestica after 24 h exposure.",Pest management science,"['D031163', 'D000818', 'D005591', 'D001517', 'D003374', 'D047309', 'D006793', 'D007313', 'D007306', 'D009036', 'D019906', 'D010936', 'D018675']","['Ageratum', 'Animals', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Coleoptera', 'Coumarins', 'Flavones', 'Houseflies', 'Insecta', 'Insecticides', 'Moths', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Plant Extracts', 'Toxicity Tests']","Compounds from Ageratum conyzoides: isolation, structural elucidation and insecticidal activity.","['Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None]","['chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17469080,2007,0,0,insecticide detection,apple,0.19101123595505617,"['Datura stramonium L.)', 'hexane extract', 'R. dominica', 'Rhyzopertha dominica', 'hexane extract of this plant', ""5'-Heptamethoxyflavone"", 'ethanol', 'hexane', 'coumarin', 'mint', '(13)C', ""5'-methylenedioxyflavone"", ""5'-heptamethoxyflavone"", 'A. conyzoides']",1,17
17458979,"Inhibitory effects of apple polyphenol extract (AP) and procyanidin contained in AP on in vitro pancreatic lipase activity and in vivo triglyceride absorption in mice and humans were examined. AP and procyanidin considerably inhibited in vitro pancreatic lipase activity. However, polyphenols, except for procyanidin, in AP (i.e., catechins, chalcones, and phenol carboxylic acids) showed weak inhibitory activities on pancreatic lipase. Procyanidins separated by normal-phase chromatography according to the degree of polymerization were also examined. Inhibitory effects of procyanidins increased according to the degree of polymerization from dimer to pentamer. On the other hand, pentamer or greater procyanidins showed maximal inhibitory effects on pancreatic lipase. These results suggested that with respect to in vitro pancreatic lipase inhibition, the degree of polymerization was an important factor and oligomeric procyanidin mainly contributed. Next, we performed a triglyceride tolerance test in mice and humans. Simultaneous ingestion of AP and triglyceride significantly inhibited an increase of plasma triglyceride levels in both models.

17458978,"Classification models for Penicillium expansum spoilage of apples and prediction models for patulin concentration in apples usable for apple juice production were made on the basis of electronic nose (e-nose) analysis correlated to HPLC quantification of patulin. A total of 15 Golden Delicious and 4 Jonagold apples were surface sterilized and divided into three groups per variety. The Golden Delicious group consisted of five apples each. Group 1 was untreated control, group 2 was surface inoculated with P. expansum, and group 3 was inoculated in the core with P. expansum. The apples were incubated at 25 degrees C for 10 days. E-nose analysis was performed daily. At day 10 the Golden Delicious apples were individually processed for apple juice production. During apple juice production the mash and juice were analyzed by e-nose, and samples were taken for patulin analysis by HPLC. The volatile metabolite profile was obtained by collection of volatile metabolites, on tubes containing Tenax TA, overnight between the 9th and 10th days of incubation and subsequent analysis of the collected compounds by GC-MS. Prediction models using partial least-squares, with high correlation, for prediction of patulin concentration in shredded apples as well as apple juice were successfully created. It was also shown that it is possible to classify P. expansum spoilage in apples correctly on the basis of soft independent modeling of class analogy classification of e-nose analysis data.

17442324,"A liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) multi-residue method for the simultaneous target analysis of a wide range of pesticides and metabolites in fruit, vegetables and cereals has been developed. Gradient elution has been used in conjunction with positive mode electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry to detect up to 171 pesticides and/or metabolites in different crop matrices using a single chromatographic run. Pesticide residues were extracted/partitioned from the samples with acetone/dichloromethane/light petroleum. The analytical performance was demonstrated by the analysis of extracts from lettuce, orange, apple, cabbage, grape and wheat flour, spiked at three concentration levels ranging from 0.01 to 0.10 mg/kg for each pesticide and/or metabolite. In general, recoveries ranging from 70 to 110%, with relative standard deviations better than 15%, were obtained. The recovery and repeatability data are in good accordance with EU guidelines for pesticide residue analysis. The limit of quantification for all targeted pesticides and metabolites tested was 0.01 mg/kg.

17426025,"Eimeria tenella, in common with other parasitic protozoa of the phylum Apicomplexa, invades host cells using an actinomyosin-powered ""glideosome"" complex and requires the secretion of adhesive proteins from the microneme organelles onto the parasite surface. Microneme proteins of E. tenella include EtMIC4, a transmembrane protein that has multiple thrombospondin type I domains and calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domains in its extracellular domain, and EtMIC5, a soluble protein composed of 11 tandemly repeated domains that belong to the plasminogen-apple-nematode superfamily. We show here that EtMIC4 and EtMIC5 interact to form an oligomeric, ultrahigh molecular mass protein complex. The complex was purified from lysed parasites by non-denaturing techniques, and the stoichiometry was shown to be [EtMIC4](2):[EtMIC5](1), with an octamer of EtMIC4 bound non-covalently to a tetramer of EtMIC5. The complex is formed within the parasite secretory pathway and is maintained after secretion onto the surface of the parasite.

A methodology for the precise and accurate determination of the (87)Sr/(86)Sr isotope abundance ratio in ciders by multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) was developed. Major elements (Na, K, Ca and Mg) were measured by ICP-AES and minor and trace elements (Li, Be, B, Al, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Y, Mo, Cd, Sn, Sb, Cs, Ba, La, Ce, W, Tl, Pb, Bi, Th and U) were measured by ICP-MS using a collision cell instrument operated in multitune mode. An analysis of variance (ANOVA test) indicated that group means for B, Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, Se, Cd, Cs, Ce, W, Pb, Bi and U did not show any significant differences at the 95% confidence level, so these elements were rejected for further statistical analysis. Another group of elements (Li, Be, Sc, Co, Ga, Y, Sn, Sb, La, Tl, Th) was removed from the data set because concentrations were close to the limits of detection for many samples. Therefore, the remaining elements (Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Zn, As, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ba) together with (87)Sr/(86)Sr isotope abundance ratio were considered for principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

17399731,"Large volume injection, up to 5 mL, was evaluated and optimised for the on-line ion chromatographic separation of Rb and Sr before ICP-MS measurement of Sr isotope ratios. Flat-topped chromatographic peaks, ideally suited for multicollector ICP-MS isotope ratio measurements, could be obtained when the composition of the mobile phase (nitric acid and 18-crown-6 ether) was identical to the matrix of the sample. Under those conditions rubidium eluted at the dead volume of the column while strontium produced a flat-topped transient signal with several minutes of stable plateau. On-line data acquisition during several minutes at the plateau of Sr signal allowed high precision Sr isotope ratio measurement. The developed procedure was evaluated for Sr isotope ratio measurements on different types of samples, including cider, apples, apple leaves, and soil extracts, in the frame of a long-term project aiming at origin authentication using strontium isotope ratio measurements. It was observed that sample matrix caused broadening of the strontium chromatographic peak and loss of flat-topped peak profile. Under those circumstances the addition of the complexing crown-ether 18-crown-6 both to samples and chromatographic eluent provided two distinct advantages. First, a drastic increase in the retention of strontium was observed which could be modulated by increasing the concentration of nitric acid in the eluent up to 900 mM. This increase in the eluent HNO(3) concentration allowed the application of the method to acid soil digests and other high acidity samples. Second, the matrix of the sample did not affect any more the chromatographic peak profile and similar chromatographic separations could be obtained for samples and standards maintaining the flat-topped Sr peak profile. Sample preparation consisted of a simple 1:10 dilution of the cider or pre-treated solid samples by adding HNO(3) (900 mM) and 18-crown-6 ether (5mM) to obtain similar composition in the sample solution and the HPLC eluent.",Journal of chromatography.

Here, we observed that procyanidin-rich dietary apple polyphenol (APP) from unripe apples alleviates the perturbation of lipid metabolism by decreasing the exogenous COP levels in rats. Dietary COPs may be the greatest source of COPs found in the human body. Rats (4 weeks of age) were fed AIN-purified diets containing 0.3% COPs supplemented with 0.5 or 2.5% APP for 3 weeks. Dietary APP alleviated the growth inhibition action of the exogenous COPs. The modulations of the liver lipid profile by COPs remained unchanged. However, serum total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels increased following the intake of dietary APP. Further, dietary APP inhibited the increase in lipid peroxide levels in the liver and serum by COPs. The activity of hepatic Delta6 desaturase was lowered by dietary APP in a dose-dependent manner, although exogenous COPs generally increased the activity of this enzyme. In keeping with this observation, Delta6 desaturation indices in the phospholipids and cholesteryl esters of the liver and serum lipids were lower in the APP-fed groups than those in the control group. Dietary APP also promoted the excretion of exogenous COPs, cholesterol, and acidic steroids in feces. Therefore, the inhibition of intestinal absorption of COPs may partly contribute to the alleviation of the perturbation of lipid metabolism and lipid peroxidation levels. Thus, APP may be an important removal agent of exogenous toxic material such as COPs contained in processed or fast foods.",Lipids,"['D000818', 'D001835', 'D002791', 'D002849', 'D004789', 'D004912', 'D005243', 'D005419', 'D007408', 'D050356', 'D008054', 'D008055', 'D027845', 'D013058', 'D015394', 'D010084', 'D010636', 'D059808', 'D011453', 'D051381', 'D017207', 'D013256', 'D013482']","['Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Cholesterol, Dietary', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Erythrocytes', 'Feces', 'Flavonoids', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxides', 'Lipids', 'Malus', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phenols', 'Polyphenols', 'Prostaglandins', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Steroids', 'Superoxide Dismutase']",Absorption of dietary cholesterol oxidation products and their downstream metabolic effects are reduced by dietary apple polyphenols.,"[None, 'Q000187', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000008', 'Q000187', 'Q000187', 'Q000378', 'Q000097', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000187', 'Q000008', None, 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378']","[None, 'drug effects', 'metabolism', None, 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'administration & dosage', 'drug effects', 'drug effects', 'metabolism', 'blood', 'chemistry', None, None, 'drug effects', 'administration & dosage', None, 'metabolism', None, None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17393221,2007,0,0,feces of rats,apple,0.1935483870967742,"['peroxide', 'polyphenol', 'triglyceride', 'steroids', 'cholesterol', 'cholesteryl esters', 'COPs', 'COP']",1,18
17388606,"In this article, we report on the use of miniaturized and automated enzymatic assays as an alternative technology for fast sugar and acid quantification in apples and tomatoes. Enzymatic assays for d-glucose, d-fructose, sucrose, D-sorbitol/xylitol, L-malic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, and L-glutamic acid were miniaturized from the standard 3 mL assays in cuvettes into assays of 200 microL or lower in 96 or 384 well microplates. The miniaturization and the automation were achieved with a four channel automatic liquid handling system in order to reduce the dispensing errors and to obtain an increased sample throughput. Performance factors (limit of detection, linearity of calibration curve, and repeatability) of the assays with standard solutions were proven to be satisfactory. The automated and miniaturized assays were validated with high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses for the quantification of sugars and acids in tomato and apple extracts. The high correlation between the two techniques for the different components indicates that the high-throughput microplate enzymatic assays can serve as a fast, reliable, and inexpensive alternative for HPLC as the standard analysis technique in the taste characterization of fruit and vegetables.

17335222,"The biosynthesis of volatile esters by Red Delicious apples was investigated by incubating fruit tissue with deuterated flavor precursors at various times after controlled atmosphere (CA) storage and measuring deuterium incorporation into branched-chain ester volatiles. 2-Methylbutyl acetate was the only volatile not significantly reduced by CA storage. Conversion of 2-methylbutanol to 2-methylbutyl acetate and of 2-methylbutanoic acid to ethyl 2-methylbutanoate and to hexyl 2-methylbutanoate was limited by the availability of 2-methylbutyl substrates but not by acetyl-CoA, ethanol, or hexanol, respectively. The enzymatic activity required for these reactions declined during CA storage. The conversion of 2-methylbutanoic acid to 2-methylbutanol was also substrate limited, but enzymic activity appeared stable in storage. Biosynthesis of both 2-methylbutanoic acid and 2-methylbutanol, from isoleucine, was severely depressed under CA storage. The reduced metabolism of isoleucine to 2-methylbutanoyl-CoA may be the primary reason for reduced branched-chain ester synthesis in CA-stored Red Delicious apples.

The removal of ASX does not affect the thermal or chemical stability of the quaternary structure.

Simultaneously hepatic lipid peroxidation (LPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were investigated to observe its hepatotoxic effect, if any. L-T(4) administration (0.5 mg/kg/d for 12 days, i.p.) increased the levels of serum T(3) and T(4), activity of hepatic G-6-Pase, 5'DI and LPO with a parallel decrease in SOD and CAT activities. However, simultaneous administration of the Annona seed extract (200 mg/kg) or quercetin (10 mg/kg) to T(4)-induced hyperthyroid animals for 10 days, reversed all these effects indicating their potential in the regulation of hyperthyroidism.

17223120,"A novel method was developed for the separation of proanthocyanidins (PAs; oligomeric flavan-3-ols) by hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) using an amide-silica column eluting with an aqueous acetonitrile mobile phase. The best separation was achieved with a linear gradient elution of acetonitrile-water at ratios of 9:1 to 5:5 (v/v) for 60 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Under these HPLC conditions, a mixture of natural oligomeric PAs (from apple) was separated according to degree of polymerization (DP) up to decamers. The DP of each separated oligomer was confirmed by LC/electrospray ionization MS. In further HILIC separation studies of 15 different flavan-3-ol and oligomeric PA (up to pentamer) standards with an isocratic elution of acetonitrile-water (84:16), a high correlation was observed between the logarithm of retention factors (log k) and the number of hydroxyl groups in their structures. The coefficient of this correlation (r2=0.9501) was larger than the coefficient (r2=0.7949) obtained from the correlation between log k and log P(o/w) values. These data reveal that two effects, i.e. hydrogen bonding between the carbamoyl terminal on the column and the hydroxyl group of solute oligomer and hydrophilicity based on the high-order structure of oligomeric PAs, corporately contribute to the separation, but the hydrogen bonding effect is predominant in our HILIC separation mode.",Journal of chromatography.

Twenty-four samples of cider purchased from commercial sources were analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection after precolumn derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde. Amine levels were variable, ranging from not detected to 23 mg/liter. The average level of total biogenic amines in ciders was 5.94 +/- 8.42 mg/liter.

17181777,"Anthocyanin concentration is an important determinant of the colour of many fruits. In apple (Malus x domestica), centuries of breeding have produced numerous varieties in which levels of anthocyanin pigment vary widely and change in response to environmental and developmental stimuli. The apple fruit cortex is usually colourless, although germplasm does exist where the cortex is highly pigmented due to the accumulation of either anthocyanins or carotenoids. From studies in a diverse array of plant species, it is apparent that anthocyanin biosynthesis is controlled at the level of transcription. Here we report the transcript levels of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in a red-fleshed apple compared with a white-fleshed cultivar. We also describe an apple MYB transcription factor, MdMYB10, that is similar in sequence to known anthocyanin regulators in other species. We further show that this transcription factor can induce anthocyanin accumulation in both heterologous and homologous systems, generating pigmented patches in transient assays in tobacco leaves and highly pigmented apple plants following stable transformation with constitutively expressed MdMYB10. Efficient induction of anthocyanin biosynthesis in transient assays by MdMYB10 was dependent on the co-expression of two distinct bHLH proteins from apple, MdbHLH3 and MdbHLH33. The strong correlation between the expression of MdMYB10 and apple anthocyanin levels during fruit development suggests that this transcription factor is responsible for controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple fruit; in the red-fleshed cultivar and in the skin of other varieties, there is an induction of MdMYB10 expression concurrent with colour formation during development. Characterization of MdMYB10 has implications for the development of new varieties through classical breeding or a biotechnological approach.",The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,"['D000595', 'D000872', 'D002851', 'D005638', 'D020869', 'D018506', 'D008156', 'D027845', 'D008969', 'D010858', 'D018515', 'D030821', 'D020133', 'D016415', 'D017422', 'D017386', 'D014026', 'D014157', 'D014170']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anthocyanins', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Fruit', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant', 'Luciferases', 'Malus', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pigmentation', 'Plant Leaves', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tobacco', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transformation, Genetic']","Red colouration in apple fruit is due to the activity of the MYB transcription factor, MdMYB10.","[None, 'Q000096', None, 'Q000201', None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000201', None, 'Q000502', 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None]","[None, 'biosynthesis', None, 'enzymology', None, None, 'metabolism', 'enzymology', None, 'physiology', 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, 'genetics', 'genetics', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17181777,2007,0,1,Apple skin,apple,0.12745098039215685,"['apple anthocyanin', 'anthocyanins', 'carotenoids', 'Anthocyanin', 'MdMYB10', 'anthocyanin']",1,13

Compare to other cell wall polysaccharide fractions, in Na(2)CO(3)-soluble pectic fractions of apple fruit, there were abundant rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I), which branched highly in side chains due to the compositions of arabinans, galactans, arabinogalactans etc. As for cell wall polysaccharides, in 'Kinsei' apples, the decrease of pectic fractions was shown most significantly in Na(2)CO(3)-1 fraction, which was associated with a significant degradation of arabinosyl and galactosyl residues on the side chains. Further more, higher molecular mass in Na(2)CO(3)-1 pectic polysaccharides degraded and turned into ones with smaller molecular mass.

One hundred and ninety-nine pesticides were added to matrix of potato, spinach, cabbage, apple, orange, soybean and unpolished rice at twice the limits of quantitation. The recoveries of 194 pesticides from all crops were satisfactory (50-150%) for screening purposes. Although some pesticides in apple and orange were not determined by selected ion monitoring (SIM) analysis at the limits of quantitation, all of them were identified by ion-trap GC/MS/MS at the same concentration. Thus, the ion trap GC/MS/MS technique is useful for the screening of residual pesticides present at low levels in agricultural products.",Shokuhin eiseigaku zasshi.

17071519,"Traditionally, the screening of unknown pesticides in food has been accomplished by GC/MS methods using conventional library-searching routines. However, many of the new polar and thermally labile pesticides are more readily and easily analysed by LC/MS methods and no searchable libraries currently exist (with the exception of some user libraries, which are limited). Therefore, there is a need for LC/MS libraries that can detect pesticides and their degradation products. This paper reports an identification scheme using a combination of LC/MS time-of-flight (accurate mass) and an Access database of 350 pesticides that are amenable to positive ion electrospray. The approach differs from conventional library searching of fragment ions. The concept consists of three parts: (1) initial screening of possible pesticides in actual market-place fruit extracts (apple and orange) using accurate mass and generating an accurate mass via an automatic ion-extraction routine, (2) searching the Access database manually for screening identification of a pesticide, and (3) identification of the suspected compound by accurate mass of at least one fragment ion and comparison of retention time with an actual standard.

Pesticides were extracted from homogenized food samples with acetonitrile and decontaminated via the matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) technique, using a primary secondary amine as sorbent prior to GPC-GC/MS analysis. A slightly modified preparation method and automated GPC step proved useful in minimizing matrix interference. To evaluate the performance of the system, 97 target pesticides were spiked at a concentration of 0.1mg/kg into a range of food types, including potato, cabbage, carrot, apple, orange, cucumber, and rice. A low flow rate of 0.1 mL/min in GPC resulted in a 40-fold reduction in solvent consumption compared with conventional GPC column applications. The combination of MSPD technique and GPC-GC/MS for the analysis of the 97 pesticides can be accomplished within 90 min.

The purpose of this work was to establish a real-time PCR method, which can detect and quantify apple pathogenic and toxigenic Alternaria. An AM-toxin I primer set, which could recognize Alternaria DNA only, was designed by using primers complementary to the AM-toxin I gene. The method could detect small amounts of DNA (4 pg) and still obtain a large dynamic range (4 decades) without interference from apple material. Eight Alternaria isolates were analyzed for the presence of AM-toxin I gene and their production of secondary metabolites. Then analyses showed that all eight isolates contained the AM toxin gene and were able to produce the plant pathogenic tentoxin in addition to AM toxin I. The analyses also showed the production of tenuazonic acid, alternariols, Altenuene, altenusin and/or altertoxin I in pure culture. Analyses of inoculated apples showed that both the AM-toxin gene and alternariol monomethyl ether could be detected. Morphological analyses suggested that the eight Alternaria strains, though they all carried the AM toxin genes, probably belong to different but closely related un-described Alternaria taxa in the A. tenuissima species-group based on morphological and chemical differences.",International journal of food microbiology,"['D000528', 'D002851', 'D007783', 'D027845', 'D009183', 'D016133', 'D012680', 'D013720']","['Alternaria', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Lactones', 'Malus', 'Mycotoxins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tenuazonic Acid']",Real-time PCR quantification of the AM-toxin gene and HPLC qualification of toxigenic metabolites from Alternaria species from apples.,"['Q000378', 'Q000379', 'Q000302', 'Q000737', 'Q000096', 'Q000379', None, 'Q000302']","['metabolism', 'methods', 'isolation & purification', 'chemistry', 'biosynthesis', 'methods', None, 'isolation & purification']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16890318,2006,0,0,mycotoxin,apple,0.057971014492753624,"['tenuazonic acid', 'Altenuene', 'monomethyl ether', 'altenusin']",1,4

Fifteen relevant off-flavor compounds that are formed in apple juice, for example, by the strains Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris and Actinomycetes (Streptomyces ssp.) were investigated with respect to their sensory relevance. The odor threshold values (i.e., detection and recognition values) were determined for all compounds in the matrix apple juice. Odor threshold values for fenchyl alcohol are reported here for the first time. The obtained values were set in relation to the limits of detection and quantification of a previously published GC-MS method.

16847702,"A method based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was developed for the rapid and non-destructive determination and quantification of solid and dissolved amino acids. The statistical results obtained after optimisation of measurement conditions were evaluated on the basis of statistical parameters, Q-value (quality of calibrations), R(2), standard error of estimation (SEE), standard error of prediction (SEP), BIAS applying cluster and different multivariate analytical procedures. Experimental optimisation comprised the selection of the highest suitable optical thin-layer (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 mm), sample temperature (10-30 degrees C), measurement option (light fibre, 0.5 mm optical thin-layer; boiling point tube; different types of cuvettes) and sample concentration in the range between 100 and 500 ppm. Applying the optimised conditions and a 115-QS Suprasil cuvette (V = 400 microl), the established qualitative model enabled to distinguish between different dissolved amino acids with a Q-value of 0.9555. Solid amino acids were investigated in the transflectance mode, allowing to differentiate them with a Q-value of 0.9155. For the qualitative and quantitative analysis of amino acids in complex matrices NIRS was established as a detection system directly onto the plate after prior separation on cellulose based thin-layer chromatography (TLC) sheets employing n-butanol, acetic acid and distilled water at a ratio of 8:4:2 (v/v/v) as an optimised mobile phase. Due to the prior separation step, the established calibration curve was found to be more stable than the one calculated from the dissolved amino acids. The found lower limit of detection was 0.01 mg/ml. Finally, this optimised TLC-NIRS method was successfully applied for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of L-lysine in apple juice. NIRS is shown not only to offer a fast, non-destructive detection tool but also to provide an easy-to-use alternative to more complicated detection methods such as mass spectrometry (MS) for qualitative and quantitative TLC analysis of amino acids in crude samples.",Amino acids,"['D000596', 'D002855', 'D016000', 'D015999', 'D012680', 'D019265']","['Amino Acids', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared']","Near infrared spectroscopy, cluster and multivariate analysis hyphenated to thin layer chromatography for the analysis of amino acids.","['Q000032', 'Q000379', None, None, None, 'Q000379']","['analysis', 'methods', None, None, None, 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16847702,2007,0,1,amino acids in apple juice,apple,0.10989010989010989,"['acetic acid', 'amino acids', 'dissolved amino acids', 'microl', 'n-butanol', 'L-lysine']",1,10

16787040,"Detection of juice-to-juice adulteration based on chemical composition studies is a common method used by government regulatory agencies and food companies. This study investigated the use of major carbohydrate (fructose, glucose and sucrose), polyol (sorbitol), proline, and phenolic profiles as indicators of pear adulteration of apple juice (PAAJ). For this work, a total of 105 authentic apple juice samples from 13 countries and 27 authentic pear juice samples from 5 countries were analyzed. Because the major carbohydrate ranges for these juices showed significant overlap their use as markers for PAAJ detection would be very limited. It was found that sorbitol and proline means for apple and pear were significantly different; however, their broad natural ranges would afford PAAJ at levels up to 30% without detection. In addition, careful selection of the pear juice used as the adulterant would further limit the usefulness of these markers for PAAJ detection. Arbutin was conclusively identified as a marker for pear juice on the basis of its presence in all 27 authentic pear samples and its absence (<0.5 microg/mL) in all 105 apple juice samples analyzed in this study.

In studying these interactions, it is desirable to collect volatiles from plants that have not been excised and are growing under as natural conditions as possible. We compared a vessel of borosilicate glass and Nylon-6 or polyester [poly(ethyleneterephthalate) or PET] cooking bags for enclosing plants during collection of volatiles. A push-pull airflow system was used, and volatiles were trapped on Tenax TA and analyzed by gas chromatography after thermal desorption. Low levels of impurities were found for the glass vessel and polyester bags. Nylon bags contained higher levels and more impurities. Recoveries of standards of 10 plant volatiles were measured in static and dynamic systems. In a static air system, there was good recovery only from the glass vessel. In a dynamic system, there was generally good recovery from both the glass vessel and polyester bags. Recoveries of alpha-pinene and (Z)-jasmone were poor throughout. The former was shown to have a very low breakthrough volume on the Tenax TA adsorbent, and the latter may be strongly adsorbed on glass. All three materials were essentially transparent in the IR and visible (photosynthetic) range but with significantly different absorptions in the UV range. In a simulated dynamic entrainment in full sunlight, internal vessel temperatures were higher than ambient by up to 9.5 degrees C in the glass vessel and 7.5 degrees C in the polyester bag. Lower increases in temperature relative to ambient (<1 degrees C) were recorded when entrainments were conducted in the shade.

16685329,"Chlorophyll-a contained in the peel of Granny Smith apples emits fluorescence upon excitation with blue light. The observed emission, collected by an external detector and corrected by its spectral response, is still distorted by light reabsorption processes taking place in the fruit skin and differs appreciably from the true spectral distribution of fluorescence emerging from chlorophyll molecules in the biological tissue. Reabsorption processes particularly affect the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 680 nm and at 730 nm. A model to obtain the correct spectral distribution of the emission, from the experimental fluorescence recorded at a fluorometer detector and corrected for the detector spectral sensitivity, is developed in the present work.

YING, a type of Taiwanese indigenous plant, were evaluated for potential application in the field of skin care. A phytochemical investigation of the active fractions resulted in the isolation of seven compounds of which the structures were identified by spectroscopic characterization. In the present study, the isolated phenolic compounds were evaluated for their free radical-scavenging activities against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and the superoxide radicals, anti-elastase, and for their anti-matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) activity in human skin fibroblast cells. Of these compounds, 3-hydroxyphloridzin (2), 3-hydroxyphloretin (6), and quercetin (7) exhibited the strongest DPPH and superoxide radical-scavenging activities. The IC50 values of these compounds were 9.2, 7.7, and 15.4 microM, respectively, for the DPPH radical, and 25.0, 19.6, and 42.6 microM, respectively, for the superoxide radical. 3-Hydroxyphloridzin (2) and 3-hydroxyphloretin (6) also showed xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity, with IC(50) values of 52.1 and 22.4 muM, respectively. In the test for elastase inhibitory activity, phloretin (5) and 3-hydroxyphloretin (6) were the most potent compounds. Phloretin (5), 3-hydroxyphloretin (6), and quercetin (7) showed better inhibition of MMP-1 production in fibroblast cells.

Various alcohols, aldehydes, acetals, alkylpyrazines, furan derivatives, lactones, and sulfur-containing and phenolic compounds were also found to be important. On the basis of flavor dilution (FD) values, the most important aroma compounds in Wuliangye and Jiannanchun liquors could be ethyl butanoate, ethyl pentanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, butyl hexanoate, ethyl 3-methylbutanoate, hexanoic acid, and 1,1-diethoxy-3-methylbutane (FD > or = 1024).

Thirty-six odorant compounds were detected, 24 of which were common to all extracts. A significant correlation coefficient was found between the aroma intensity scores and overall quantity of the odorant volatiles, which shows that the development of sensory aroma is similar to that of odorant volatiles. This study also showed that the parameters measured by penetrometry and compression were highly correlated with sensory textural attributes. The determination of the optimal maturity stage for different apple cultivars by the usual parameters, such as color, diameter, total soluble solids, and titrable acidity, may not be sufficient to determine the optimal sensory quality for consumers.

A method has been developed that uses mass spectrometry to identify a protein toxin, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), in a model food matrix, apple juice. The approach employs ultrafiltration to remove low molecular weight components from the sample, after which the remaining high molecular weight fraction, containing the protein, is digested with trypsin. The tryptic fragments are separated from residual biopolymers and analyzed by liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry. The background is still sufficiently complex that tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is used to confirm the identity of target peptides. Limits of detection are 80 ng of SEB for MS and 100 ng for full scan MS/MS, using a tryptic fragment as the analytical target. Lower detection limits can be obtained using selected ion monitoring and multiple reaction monitoring.

Azinphos-methyl, phosalone, and phosmet, which were applied, were detected in all samples analyzed at concentrations ranging from 0.004 ng/g to 2260 ng/g. Methidathion was not observed in any sample. Chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dimethoate, and malathion concentrations ranged from below method detection limits to 0.71 ng/g, and the detection frequency for these compounds ranged from 20% to 100%.

16480799,"Excessive application of lead arsenate pesticides in apple orchards during the early 1900s has led to the accumulation of lead and arsenic in these soils. Lead and arsenic bound to soil humic acids (HA) and soil arsenic species in a western Massachusetts apple orchard was investigated. The metal-humate binding profiles of Pb and As were analyzed with size exclusion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SEC-ICP-MS). It was observed that both Pb and As bind ""tightly"" to soil HA molar mass fractions. The surface soils of the apple orchard contained a ratio of about 14:1 of water soluble As (V) to As (III), while mono-methyl (MMA) and di-methyl arsenic (DMA) were not detectable. The control soil contained comparatively very low levels of As (III) and As (V). The analysis of soil core samples demonstrated that As (III) and As (V) species are confined to the top 20 cm of the soil.","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)","['D000327', 'D000383', 'D001151', 'D001152', 'D002852', 'D004784', 'D006812', 'D007854', 'D009682', 'D027845', 'D013058', 'D008404', 'D017942', 'D010573', 'D012987', 'D012989', 'D014197']","['Adsorption', 'Agriculture', 'Arsenic', 'Arsenicals', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Humic Substances', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malus', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Massachusetts', 'Nitric Acid', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Soil', 'Soil Pollutants', 'Trees']","Distribution of soil arsenic species, lead and arsenic bound to humic acid molar mass fractions in a contaminated apple orchard.","[None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000379', None, 'Q000032', None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None]","[None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'methods', None, 'analysis', None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16480799,2007,0,0,soil,apple,0.26,"['arsenate pesticides', '14:1', 'DMA', 'soil HA', 'soil humic acids', 'arsenic', 'soil', 'Pb', 'MMA', 'HA']",1,13
16478247,"The polyphenolic and ascorbate (ASC) components as well as the antioxidant capacity of Kei-apple (Dovyalis caffra) juice were analyzed and compared to three other fruit juices. The Kei-apple juice had significantly the highest total polyphenolic concentrations (1013 mg gallic acid equivalent/L), and solid phase (C(18)) fractionation identified the majority of these polyphenols to be phenolic acids. The Kei-apple juice also had significantly the highest ASC concentrations (658 mg/L), which showed exceptional heat stability with very little conversion to dehydroascorbate (DHA). Antioxidant capacities of both the unfractionated fruit juices and their solid phase-extracted fractions, as determined by oxygen radical absorbance capacity and ferric reducing antioxidant power analyses, correlated well to the polyphenol concentrations. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses showed caffeic acid as the most abundant polyphenol present (128.7 mg/L) in the Kei-apple juice; it contributed to 63% of the total antioxidant capacity (of all of the individual compounds identified). Other notable polyphenols identified in higher concentrations included p-coumaric acid, p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and protocatechuic acid.

16448197,"The impact of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) on the synthesis and retention of flavonoid compounds during storage and ripening of red Delicious (Malus x domestica Borkh.) apples was investigated. Numerous anthocyanins, flavonols, flavan-3-ols, and a hydroxycinnamic acid from three different fruit harvest maturities were monitored after a 120 day storage and 1 week shelf life period using high-performance liquid chromatography/diode array detector analysis. The total flavonoid concentration was 5% greater in fruit treated with 1-MCP, whereas chlorogenic acid levels were 24% lower. All compounds analyzed increased in concentration during fruit harvest; however, the anthocyanins generally declined after storage, while chlorogenic acid levels increased. 1-MCP treatment resulted in the retention of anthocyanins in the latter stages of storage but did not affect the flavonols and flavan-3-ols. Chlorogenic acid biosynthesis from early and optimal fruit harvest maturities was greatly inhibited by 1-MCP during storage and the 1 week shelf life period. However, 1-MCP did not affect chlorogenic acid concentrations in late-harvested fruit. Results suggest that 1-MCP may inhibit the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and subsequent biosynthesis of flavonoid compounds.

This was achieved by a combination of MALDI-MS/MS de novo sequencing of double-derivatized peptides and indel-tolerant searching against local protein databases built on both EST and full-length nucleotide sequences. The amino acid sequence of a strawberry allergen, homologous to the well-known major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1, was partially determined. This strawberry allergen, named Fra a 1 according to the nomenclature for allergen proteins, showed sequence identity of 54 and 77%, respectively, with corresponding allergens from birch and apple. Differential expression, as evaluated by 2-D DIGE, occurred in 10% of protein spots when red strawberries were compared to a colorless (white) strawberry mutant. White strawberries, known to be tolerated by individuals affected by allergy, were found to be virtually free from the strawberry allergen. Also several enzymes in the pathway for biosynthesis of flavonoids, to which the red color pelargonidin belongs, were down-regulated.

For this reason, XOD inhibitor, which effectively suppresses this enzyme, plays an important role in the inhibition of many diseases related to reactive oxygen species (ROS). In order to screen XOD inhibitors rapidly and conveniently, a novel assay using flow injection analysis (FIA) was proposed in the present investigation. To optimize the practical FIA system, we studied the effect of the reagent concentrations and the flow condition on the enzymatic reaction, and then selected the optimum condition as follows: 200-mU/ml XOD concentration, 0.5-mM xanthine concentration, 0.5-ml/min flow rate, and 2-m mixing coil length. Under this condition, a typical XOD inhibitor quercetin was determined in the concentration range 0.1 - 1.5 mM at a sampling frequency of 10 samples/h. Using the optimized FIA method, we determined the XOD inhibitory activity of some food samples: onions, apples and teas, which are the high sources of flavonoids known as the potential XOD inhibitors.

The linearity of the standard curve produced for the kit-assembled standard solutions (slope = -0.3829) agreed with that of the curve produced for the self-made standard solutions (slope = -0.3619). The sensitivity (I50 value) and the limit of detection for the kit were 0.23 and 0.033 ng/g, respectively.

16381059,"A rapid, sensitive and selective method has been developed for the direct determination of ethephon residues in vegetables (apple, cherry and tomato). Given the anionic character of ethephon, the use of ion-pairing liquid chromatography (LC) in combination with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS, triple quadrupole) allowed its direct determination in these matrices avoiding a derivatisation step and favouring the automation of the method. Samples were extracted with a mixture of dichloromethane/aqueous formic acid (pH 3) (1:1). Then, tetrabutylammonium acetate (TBA) was added as an ion-pairing reagent, and an aliquot of the aqueous extract was directly injected into the LC/MS/MS system. Quantification was performed with matrix-matched standards prepared from blank sample extracts. MS/MS measurements were made in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode, using the most sensitive transition (m/z 107 > 79) for quantification, and up to four additional transitions for confirmation. Quantitative recoveries were obtained for all matrices (between 83% and 96%) at two concentration levels tested (0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg), with relative standard deviations lower than 9% in all cases. The addition of TBA directly into the sample extract contained in the injection vial was found sufficient to obtain satisfactory LC retention for the analyte. Under these conditions, the absence of ion-pairing reagent in the mobile phase minimised the ionisation suppression for ethephon in the MS source, leading to an increase in the sensitivity of the method and reaching limits of detection of 0.02 mg/kg for all matrices investigated. The acquisition of five specific MS/MS transitions for ethephon allowed the simultaneous and reliable quantification and confirmation of the analyte in the samples.",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"['D002853', 'D009943', 'D010937', 'D021241', 'D014675']","['Chromatography, Liquid', 'Organophosphorus Compounds', 'Plant Growth Regulators', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Vegetables']",An ion-pairing liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric method for the determination of ethephon residues in vegetables.,"['Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737']","['methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16381059,2006,0,0,herbicide detection,apple,0.10843373493975904,"['TBA', 'tetrabutylammonium acetate', 'aqueous extract', 'formic acid', 'ethephon']",1,9

SEM showed the presence of round granules as well as granules that had been partially degraded, probably by amylases. The starch granules in different apple starches ranged between 4.1 and 12.0 mum. Debranching of starch with isoamylase and subsequent fractionation of debranched materials by GPC revealed the presence of an apparent amylose, an intermediate fraction (mixture of amylose and amylopectin), long side chains of amylopectin, and short side chains of amylopectin in the range of 28-35.2, 3.6-4.4, 20-21.3, and 39.9-47.1%, respectively. The swelling power of starches ranged between 14.4 and 21.3 g/g. X-ray diffraction of apple starches showed a mixture of A- and B-type patterns. All apple starches showed peak intensities lower than that observed for normal corn and potato starch, indicating the lower crystallinity.

16366668,"In this work, a single flow injection multicommuted system using solid-surface fluorescence spectroscopy has been explored for the determination of diphenylamine in apples and pears. The native fluorescence signal of diphenylamine retained on the solid support (C18 silica gel) was used for its determination (lambda(exc)/lambda(em) 291/372 nm). The sample treatment consists of a liquid-liquid extraction with acetonitrile followed by a cleanup step using primary-secondary amines. The use of a continuous flow assembly implementing multicommutation, based on a set of three-way solenoid valves controlled by appropriate software, provides the automatic control of sample, carrier, and eluting solution with remarkable advantages in relation to conventional flow injection approaches. Using an optimized sampling time, the proposed method was linear in the range 0.25-5 mg kg(-1) with a detection limit of 0.06 mg kg(-1) and RSD (percent) values better than 3%. The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of diphenylamine in different apple and pear samples fortified at different concentrations, and recoveries between 78 and 104% were found.

16361796,"Aroma volatiles from apple (Malus domestica Borkh. var. Starkrimson) fruit at different stages of maturity were collected by solid adsorbent-Tenax-GC and determined by thermodesorption and GC-MS. Production of propyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl 2-methyl-butanoate and total ester volatiles and changes in concentration of the precursors of aroma biosynthsis--free amino acids and fatty acids and activities of lipoxygenases (LOX) and alcohol acetyltransferase (AAT) in apple fruits during ripening were studied. The results showed that propyl acetate and total esters were very low when the endogenous ethylene formation of the fruit was very low. At the stage of the increase in ethylene production, the rate of formation of propyl acetate and total esters increased. Butyl acetate appeared at the beginning of ethylene rise and increased thereafter. Ethyl 2-methyl-butanoate was produced at the beginning of climacteric stage and then increased sharply (Figs.1). These facts suggest that the aroma production is closely related to ethylene production. Among the 14 free amino acids detected in fruit, isoleucine which is considered to be the biosynthetic precursor of some branched chain esters showed a great increase during fruit ripening while the others decreased or remained stable (Table 1). The accumulation of isoleucine suggested that isoleucine supply in fruit may not limit the biosynthesis of esters with branched chain alkyl groups. Concentrations of free fatty acids such as palmitic, linolenic, oleic, linoleic, stearic acids increased before the increase of aroma production, decreased with the increase of aroma production and showed an increase at postclimacteric stages (Fig.2). LOX activity increased at climacteric stages and declined rapidly thereafter. AAT activity increased sharply at the early stage of fruit maturity when the aroma was very low and remained at a stable high level during fruit ripening (Fig.3) indicating that the AAT activity is not the limiting factor for aroma formation in apple fruit.",Zhi wu sheng li yu fen zi sheng wu xue xue bao = Journal of plant physiology and molecular biology,"['D000085', 'D000596', 'D005030', 'D005227', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D008084', 'D027845', 'D011506', 'D014835']","['Acetates', 'Amino Acids', 'Ethylenes', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Lipoxygenase', 'Malus', 'Proteins', 'Volatilization']",[Changes in amino acid and fatty acid contents as well as activity of some related enzymes in apple fruit during aroma production].,"['Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000201', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000201', 'Q000378', None]","['chemistry', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'enzymology', None, 'metabolism', 'enzymology', 'metabolism', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16361796,2009,0,1,aroma compounds and amino acids,apple,0.24561403508771928,"['ethyl 2-methyl-butanoate', 'linolenic', 'ethylene', 'fatty acids', 'alcohol', 'ester', 'butyl acetate', 'amino acids', 'palmitic', 'oleic', 'Malus domestica Borkh', 'propyl acetate', 'esters', 'Butyl acetate', 'linoleic', 'stearic acids', 'isoleucine']",1,28

16277414,"Spiking of tomato and apple fruits with parathion at different levels of about 1-4 mg/kg irradiation and under simulated sunlight conditions resulted in nearly complete photodegradation within 13 h, but extractable parathion degradation products could not be found in any case. However, after irradiation of an unrealistically spiked apple (134 mg/kg) different photoproducts including aminoparathion (AP) were detectable by HPLC, proving that the hitherto postulated photochemistry of parathion indeed takes place in the fruit cuticle environment. Besides the photoreduction pathway it was shown for the first time that AP is also easily formed by reduction of the primary photoproduct nitrosoparathion with thiols (cysteine, glutathione), while ascorbic acid only leaves hydroxylaminoparathion. In the presence of polyphenols, AP was effectively bound to quinone intermediates formed by both silver oxide and polyphenol oxidases. For pyrocatechol, a disubstituted o-quinone derivative could be isolated as a dark red addition product and structurally be elucidated. However, in the presence of caffeic acid, catechol, naringin, and quercetin, respectively, insoluble dark colored polymers precipitated within 48 h, while in the supernatants AP was not detectable any more. Polymer-bound and nonextractable AP was proven by transesterification with sodium ethoxide releasing O,O,O-triethyl thiophosphate which was determined by GC.

A blend of Z,Z-3,13-ODDA with 1-3% of E,Z-2,13-ODDA (binary blend) was more attractive than the single component. A third component, Z,E-3,13-ODDA, was sometimes observed in GC-EAD analyses, and enhanced attraction to the binary blend in some field bioassays. Lures containing 1 mg of binary and ternary blends attracted 18 and 28 times more male DWB moths, respectively, than caged virgin females in field trials. Attraction was strongly antagonized by addition of as little as 0.5% of E,Z-3,13-octadecadienyl acetate (E,Z-3,13-ODDA).

The combination of high sensitivity full-scan spectra incorporating accurate mass measurements (routinely better than 2 ppm accuracy) of the protonated molecules with the evidence from resolved isotopic clusters provides the ability to obtain a reduced number of possible elemental compositions (typically 1-2). Databases were then used to find the identity of the suspected species using the elemental composition as a searching criterion. The accurate mass and the generated elemental composition of characteristic fragment ions of the suspected species provide further evidence for the proposed species. With this approach we have identified the following chlorinated pesticides in different market-purchased fruit and vegetable extracts: Chlorotoluron (tomato), iprodione (apple), and procymidone (grapes). Finally, the confirmation and quantitation of these suspected species were successfully accomplished with standards.

Fuji flesh contains substantial levels of 2-methyl butyl acetate (fruity banana-like odor), while the flesh of cv. Granny Smith apples lacks this compound. Granny Smith apples accumulate mainly hexyl acetate (apple-pear odor) in their peel. Feeding experiments indicated that Fuji apples were able to convert hexanol and 2-methyl butanol to their respective acetate derivatives in vivo, while Granny Smith apples could only convert exogenous hexanol to hexyl acetate. Differential substrate specificities of the in vitro acetyl-CoA:alcohol acetyl transferase (AAT) activities were also detected among cultivars. In Granny Smith apples, the AAT activity was detected only in the peel, and its specificity was almost exclusively restricted to hexanol and cis-3-hexenol. In Fuji apples, the AAT activity was detected in both peel and flesh and apparently accepted a broader range of alcohols as substrates than the Granny Smith enzyme activity.

16118032,"N'-Nitrosonornicotine (NNN) was the first tobacco-specific nitrosamine (TSNA) identified as carcinogen in tobacco smoke, but no data exist on in vivo interactions between NNN and other tobacco alkaloids, TSNA or phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) which have been demonstrated in various studies on 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK). Acute effects on NNN metabolism were tested in male Fischer F344 rats injected s.c. with 30nmol/kg body weight (bw) [5-(3)H]NNN either alone or simultaneously with 15mumol/kg bw nicotine, nornicotine, anatabine, or anabasine, 150mumol/kg bw cotinine, 3mumol/kg bw myosmine, or 300nmol/kg bw of either N'-nitrosoanatabine or N'-nitrosoanabasine. Another group of rats was fed a diet supplemented with PEITC at 1mumol/g diet starting 24h before NNN treatment. Within 24h more than 80% and about 10% of the radioactivity was excreted with urine and feces, respectively. Urinary metabolites were separated by reversed-phase radio-HPLC and identified by co-chromatography with UV standards. In two sets of experiments with control rats treated with NNN only, 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl)butanoic acid (hydroxy acid, 44.4/44.8%), 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)butanoic acid (keto acid, 32.4/31.5%), NNN-N-oxide (5.0/3.8%), 4-(3-pyridyl)butane-1,4-diol (diol, 1.1/1.0%) and norcotinine (2.3/1.0%) were consistently detected besides unmetabolised NNN (4.7/3.3%). Co-treatment with nicotine, cotinine, nornicotine and PEITC shifted the contribution of the two major metabolites significantly in favor of hydroxy acid (108-113% of control) as compared to keto acid (86-90% of control). The same treatments also increased norcotinine (135-170% of control). These changes are consistent with a decreased metabolic activation of NNN. In subacute studies rats received NNN in drinking water for 4 weeks at a daily dose of 30 nmol/kg bw with or without nornicotine at 15 micromol/kg bw or myosmine at 3 micromol/kg bw. On the last day of the experiment all rats received [5-(3)H]NNN at 30 nmol/kg bw with a contaminated apple bite followed by collection of urine and feces for 18h. Most of the radioactivity, 87-96% of the dose, was recovered in urine and only minor amounts have been excreted in feces or persisted in blood. In urine of the NNN-control group keto acid (32.2%) and unmetabolised NNN (3.9%) were present in identical amounts as in the acute experiment whereas hydroxy acid (41.4% of total radioactivity in urine, 93% of acute NNN control) was reduced in expense of the minor NNN metabolites. Co-administration of nornicotine resulted in a small but significant rise of keto acid (107% of control) and a significant decrease in NNN-N-oxide (76% of control). After co-treatment with myosmine the increase of keto acid (104% of control) was even less but still significant whereas NNN-N-oxide and diol were significantly reduced to 72% and 79% of control, respectively.

16114037,"Expansion to a total of 11-17 sequential alanine residues from the normal number of 10 in the polyadenine-binding protein nuclear-1 (PABPN1) results in formation of intranuclear, fibrillar inclusions in skeletal muscle and hypothalamic neurons in adult-onset, dominantly inherited oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). To understand the role that homopolymeric length may play in the protein misfolding that leads to the inclusions, we analyzed the self-assembly of synthetic poly-(L-alanine) peptides having 3-20 residues. We found that the conformational transition and structure of polyalanine (polyAla) assemblies in solution are not only length-dependent but also are determined by concentration, temperature, and incubation time. No beta-sheet complex was detected for those peptides characterized by n < 8, where n is number of alanine residues. A second group of peptides with 7 < n < 15 showed varying levels of complex formation, while for those peptides having n > 15, the interconversion process from the monomeric to the beta-sheet complex was complete under any of the tested experimental conditions. Unlike the typical tinctorial properties of amyloid fibrils, polyalanine fibrils did not show fluorescence with thioflavin T or apple-green birefringence with Congo red; however, like amyloid, X-ray diffraction showed that the peptide chains in these fibrils were oriented normal to the fibril axis (i.e., in the cross-beta arrangement). Neighboring beta-sheets are quarter-staggered in the hydrogen-bonding direction such that the alanine side-chains were closely packed in the intersheet space. Strong van der Waals contacts between side-chains in this arrangement likely account for the high stability of the macromolecular fibrillar complex in solution over a wide range of temperature (5-85 degrees C), and pH (2-10.5), and its resistance to denaturant (< 8 M urea) and to proteases (protease K, trypsin). We postulate that a similar stabilization of an expanded polyalanine stretch could form a core beta-sheet structure that mediates the intermolecular association of mutant proteins into fibrillar inclusions in human pathologies.",Proteins,"['D000682', 'D003224', 'D002479', 'D039141', 'D010455', 'D011108', 'D017510', 'D017433', 'D012995', 'D013050', 'D013329', 'D013696', 'D014961']","['Amyloid', 'Congo Red', 'Inclusion Bodies', 'Muscular Dystrophy, Oculopharyngeal', 'Peptides', 'Polymers', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Solubility', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Temperature', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",Poly-(L-alanine) expansions form core beta-sheets that nucleate amyloid assembly.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","['chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16114037,2006,0,0,apple-green color,apple,0.06382978723404255,"['urea', 'denaturant', 'K', 'alanine']",1,6

The antioxidant capacity correlated significantly (P<0.05) with the concentration of alkyl phenols in the extracts. A mixture of anacardic acids (10.0 mg/ml) showed the higher antioxidant capacity (IC50=0.60 mM) compared to cardols and cardanols (IC50>4.0 mM). The data shows that of these substances, anacardic-1 was by far the more potent antioxidant (IC50=0.27 mM) compared to cardol-1 (IC50=1.71 mM) and cardanol-1 (IC50>4.0 mM). The antioxidant capacity of anacardic acid-1 is more related to inhibition of superoxide generation (IC50=0.04 mM) and xanthine oxidase (IC50=0.30 mM) than to scavenging of hydroxyl radicals. At present a substantial amount of cashew fibre is mostly used in formulations of animal or poultry feeds. The data presented in this study, indicates that this waste product along with CNSL, both of which contain high contents of anacardic acids, could be better utilized in functional food formulations and may represent a cheap source of cancer chemopreventive agents.",Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,"['D048729', 'D031021', 'D000975', 'D002851', 'D003849', 'D004791', 'D008401', 'D007202', 'D009682', 'D010636', 'D012118', 'D021241', 'D013481', 'D014969']","['Anacardic Acids', 'Anacardium', 'Antioxidants', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Deoxyguanosine', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Phenols', 'Resorcinols', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Superoxides', 'Xanthine Oxidase']",Characterization of alkyl phenols in cashew (Anacardium occidentale) products and assay of their antioxidant capacity.,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', 'Q000037']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', 'antagonists & inhibitors']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16095792,2006,0,0,"Cashew apple, not apple",apple,0.19444444444444445,"['hexane extract', 'alkyl phenols', 'anacardic acids', '353.6', 'alkyl phenol', 'hydroxy alkyl phenols', 'xanthine', 'CNSL', 'superoxide', 'hydroxyl', 'anacardic']",1,21
16085185,"Dietary inorganic nitrate is secreted in saliva and reduced to nitrite by bacterial flora. At the acidic pH of the stomach nitrite is present as nitrous acid in equilibrium with nitric oxide (*NO), and other nitrogen oxides with nitrating and nitrosating activity. *NO in the stomach exerts several beneficial effects, but nitrosating/nitrating species have been implicated as a possible cause of epithelial neoplasia at the gastroesophageal junction. We investigated the effects of apple extracts on *NO release by human saliva at pH 2. A water extract obtained from apple homogenate increased *NO release caused by acidification of saliva. Data show that polyphenols were responsible for this activity, with chlorogenic acid and (+)-catechin the most active and concentrated species. However, ferulic acid, a hydroxycinnamic acid with only one aromatic hydroxyl group, did not increase *NO release. Fructose, the most representative sugar in apples, was also inactive. Interestingly, ascorbic acid in saliva induced a SCN(-)-enhanced burst of *NO but, unlike apple, the release was transient. The simultaneous addition of ascorbic acid and apple extract caused a burst of *NO followed by the increased steady-state level characteristic of saliva containing apple extract. Chlorogenic acid and (+)-catechin, but not ferulic acid, formed o-semiquinone radicals and nitrated polyphenols, suggesting the scavenging of *NO(2) by o-semiquinones. Our results propose that some apple polyphenols not only inhibit nitrosation/nitration but also promote *NO bio-availabilty at the gastric level, a previously unappreciated function.",Free radical biology & medicine,"['D000975', 'D001205', 'D002396', 'D003373', 'D004563', 'D004578', 'D005419', 'D005609', 'D005753', 'D006801', 'D006863', 'D027845', 'D013058', 'D008956', 'D009566', 'D009569', 'D009573', 'D010636', 'D059808', 'D012463', 'D013053', 'D013696', 'D013997', 'D015032']","['Antioxidants', 'Ascorbic Acid', 'Catechols', 'Coumaric Acids', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Flavonoids', 'Free Radicals', 'Gastric Mucosa', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Malus', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Models, Chemical', 'Nitrates', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Nitrites', 'Phenols', 'Polyphenols', 'Saliva', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Zinc']",Apples increase nitric oxide production by human saliva at the acidic pH of the stomach: a new biological function for polyphenols with a catechol group?,"['Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000737']","['chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16085185,2005,0,0,human saliva,apple,0.32222222222222224,"['hydroxycinnamic acid', 'chlorogenic acid', 'nitrogen oxides', 'NO', '(+)-catechin', 'nitrous acid', 'polyphenols', 'apple extract', 'nitrate', 'Chlorogenic acid', 'ascorbic acid', 'nitric oxide', 'Fructose', 'nitrite', 'aromatic hydroxyl', 'ferulic acid']",1,29
16079272,"The alkaloid myosmine is present not only in tobacco products but also in various foods. Myosmine is easily nitrosated, yielding 4-hydroxy-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (HPB) and the esophageal tobacco carcinogen N'-nitrosonornicotine. Due to its widespread occurrence, investigations on the metabolism and activation of myosmine are needed for risk assessment. Therefore, the metabolism of myosmine has been studied in Wistar rats treated with single oral doses of [pyridine-5-3H]myosmine at 0.001, 0.005, 0.5, and 50 micromol/kg body weight. Oral administration was achieved by feeding a labeled apple bite. Radioactivity was completely recovered in urine and feces within 48 h. At the two lower doses, 0.001 and 0.005 micromol/kg, a higher percentage of the radioactivity was excreted in urine (86.2 +/- 4.9% and 88.9 +/- 1.7%) as compared with the higher doses, 0.5 and 50 micromol/kg, where only 77.8 +/- 7.3% and 75.4 +/- 6.6% of the dose was found in urine. Within 24 h, urinary excretion of radioactivity was nearly complete with less than 4% of the total urinary output appearing between 24 and 48 h. The two major metabolites accounting for >70% of total radioactivity in urine were identified as 3-pyridylacetic acid (20-26%) and 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)butyric acid (keto acid, 50-63%) using UV-diode array detection and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements. 3-Pyridylmethanol (3-5%), 3'-hydroxymyosmine (2%) and HPB (1-3%) were detected as minor metabolites. 3'-Hydroxymyosmine is exclusively formed from myosmine and therefore might be used as a urinary biomarker for myosmine exposure in the future.",Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,"['D000470', 'D000818', 'D004305', 'D005243', 'D005260', 'D007651', 'D008297', 'D011725', 'D051381', 'D017208', 'D013997', 'D014026']","['Alkaloids', 'Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Feces', 'Female', 'Keto Acids', 'Male', 'Pyridines', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Time Factors', 'Tobacco']",Metabolism of myosmine in Wistar rats.,"['Q000032', None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', None, None, None, 'Q000737']","['analysis', None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16079272,2006,0,0,urine and feces,apple,0.234375,"['3-Pyridylmethanol', 'myosmine', ""3'-hydroxymyosmine"", '4-hydroxy-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone', 'Myosmine', ""3'-Hydroxymyosmine"", '[pyridine-5-3H]myosmine', 'nitrosated', 'keto acid', 'HPB']",1,15

15990258,"Patients in intensive care often develop stress-induced ulcers. As a preventive measure, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are administered by nasogastric tube. However, some PPIs can block the tube. The aim of this study was to compare the behaviour of three PPIs (omeprazole, lanzoprazole and esomeprazole) during the transit of the granules through the tube and to optimise their modes of administration. For each IPP, the experiment was designed to study the influence of four variables: the tube material (silicone or polyurethane), the solvent used to dilute the granules (water or apple juice), the mode of administration (in two or three doses) and the rinse volume (10 or 20 ml). We counted the granules before transit and at the tube outlet, and assayed the active drug ingredient by UV spectrometry. The assay showed complete transit of esomeprazole through the tube, but average losses of omeprazole and lanzoprazole of 39 and 33%, respectively, were observed. No significant improvement was obtained by the variables 'diluent' and 'mode of administration'. The variable 'rinse' had a significant influence. For lanzoprazole, a polyurethane tube allowed recovery of on average 86% of the active ingredient. Esomeprazole is thus the choice PPI for the treatment of patients by nasogastric tube. Using a polyurethane tube and a rinse volume of 20 ml, the administration of lanzoprazole by tube can be considered. Use of omeprazole is not recommended because none of the modes of administration tested ensured that a sufficient concentration of active ingredient reached the stomach.",International journal of pharmaceutics,"['D053799', 'D000897', 'D001628', 'D064098', 'D007441', 'D064747', 'D027845', 'D009853', 'D010316', 'D011140', 'D054328', 'D012212', 'D012828', 'D012997', 'D014867']","['2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazoles', 'Anti-Ulcer Agents', 'Beverages', 'Esomeprazole', 'Intubation, Gastrointestinal', 'Lansoprazole', 'Malus', 'Omeprazole', 'Particle Size', 'Polyurethanes', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Rheology', 'Silicones', 'Solvents', 'Water']",Comparative study and optimisation of the administration mode of three proton pump inhibitors by nasogastric tube.,"[None, 'Q000737', None, None, 'Q000379', None, None, 'Q000031', None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, 'chemistry', None, None, 'methods', None, None, 'analogs & derivatives', None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15990258,2006,0,0,apple juice used for dilution,apple,0.09523809523809523,"['esomeprazole', 'Esomeprazole', 'IPP', 'silicone', 'omeprazole']",1,8

A total of 150 apple samples from 19 different varieties were collected in two consecutive years from orchards throughout the main cultivation areas in Ireland. Adulterant samples at 10, 20, 30, and 40% w/w were prepared using two types of adulterants: a high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) with 45% fructose and 55% glucose, and a sugars solution (SUGARS) made with 60% fructose, 25% glucose, and 15% sucrose (the average content of these sugars in apple juice). The results show that NIR analysis can be used to predict adulteration of apple juices by added sugars with a detection limit of 9.5% for samples adulterated with HFCS, 18.5% for samples adulterated with SUGARS, and 17% for the combined (HFCS + SUGARS) adulterants.

The used monoclonal antibody in the ELISA kit had a high selectivity. The ELISA kit was applied to the determination of chlorfenapyr in two kinds of fruits (apple and peach). The examination of the influence of these matrices on the reliability of the assay performance indicated that the ELISA could determine it in these samples near the regulation values in Japan simply by diluting the methanolic extract or by concentrating it, without any clean-up procedures. Recovery and precision of the proposed ELISA method were assessed by fortifying fruit samples with chlorfenapyr ranging from 0.05 to 1.5 microg/g. Mean recoveries were 94.2 and 90.3% for apple and peach, and coefficients of variation were below 16% in most cases.

15826060,"Evidence suggests that increasing consumption of fruit and vegetables contributes to improved health and well-being by providing protection from diseases including various cancers and cardiovascular disease. Although there is uncertainty about which components generate this effect, an attractive hypothesis is that the antioxidants are at least partly responsible. We measured the polyphenolic concentrations in 10 different apple cultivars grown commercially in New Zealand, each sourced from three different geographic regions. Our results showed that the concentration of polyphenolics varied among the apple cultivars, with Pacific Queen containing 2.7 times the amount of polyphenolics found in Cox's Orange. Furthermore, there were significant differences in polyphenolic concentrations in fruit from different regions for some cultivars but not for others. We also measured the polyphenolic concentrations in apple skin and flesh and found that on average 46% of the polyphenolics in whole apples were in the skin. Essentially all of the flavonols (quercetin derivatives) were present in the skin. To maximize the intake of apple polyphenols, it is necessary to consume apples of cultivars with high polyphenolic concentrations such as Pacific Queen and include the skin.

15675789,"Patulin is a mycotoxin produced by mainly Penicillium species, for example, P. expansum, and Aspergillus species. There are several reports of patulin contamination in apple juice. Last year, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan set the maximum allowable level of patulin in apple juice at 50 ppb and decided that the measurement of patulin levels in apple juice products should be conducted. To this end, a simple, accurate, and selective analytical method for the detection of patulin at levels lower than 5 ppb, the detection limit, is desired. This paper reports the development of an analytical method that employs solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS). When MS measurements were conducted with the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode, the pseudomolecular ions at m/z 153 and 156 were used to monitor patulin and (13)C(3)-labeled patulin, respectively. The detection limit (S/N = 3) and the quantification limit (S/N = 10) of patulin at injection levels into LC-MS were 12.5 and 25 pg, respectively. However, when the actual sample was applied for the analysis based on the developed method including the sample preparation, the detection limit (S/N = 3) and quantification limit (S/N = 10) were 2.5 and 5 pg in sample, respectively. The calibration curve obtained for concentrations ranging from 5 to 500 ppb showed good linearity with a coefficient of determination (r (2)) of 0.999.

The estimated contribution of major phenolics and vitamin C to total anitoxidant capacity of 100 g fresh Empire apples is as follows: quercetin (60.05 VCEAC) > chlorogenic acid (12.32) > phloretin (7.41) > procyanidin B2 (7.22) > vitamin C (6.61) > epicatechin (5.10) in superoxide radical scavenging assay.

Apple extracts showed the protective effects against the inhibition of GJIC by H2O2 in a dose-dependent manner. Quercetin exerted the strongest protective effects among major antioxidants in apples on H2O2-induced inhibition of GJIC, following epicatechin, procyanidin B2, and vitamin C, while chlorogenic acid and phloretin had no effects.

15601808,"Cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) are major determinants of oral bioavailability. Development of in vivo probe(s), for both CYP3A and P-gp, which could be administered in combination, is a current goal. Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap in CYP3A and P-gp substrate selectivities; there are few discrete probes. Alfentanil is a selective CYP3A probe but not a P-gp substrate. Fexofenadine is a P-gp probe but not a CYP3A substrate. This investigation tested the hypothesis that alfentanil and fexofenadine could be administered in combination to probe first-pass CYP3A and P-gp activities in humans. Two 3-way crossover studies were conducted in healthy volunteers. In the first protocol, subjects received oral alfentanil alone, fexofenadine alone, or fexofenadine 1 hour after alfentanil. In the second protocol, subjects abstained from citrus and apple products for 5 days and received fexofenadine alone, fexofenadine 1 hour after alfentanil, or alfentanil 4 hours after fexofenadine. An assay using solid-phase extraction and electrospray liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was developed for the simultaneous quantification of plasma alfentanil and fexofenadine. In both protocols, alfentanil plasma concentrations and area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) were unaffected by fexofenadine or meal composition. Fexofenadine given 1 hour after alfentanil and followed 1 hour later by a meal containing orange or apple juice had a somewhat lower AUC compared with fexofenadine alone (geometric mean ratio with and without the interacting drug = 0.73, 90% confidence interval [CI] = 0.59-1.04). Fexofenadine given 1 hour after alfentanil and followed 2 hours later by a meal not containing citrus or apple products had an AUC that was unchanged compared with fexofenadine alone (ratio = 0.91, 90% CI = 0.70-1.35). These results show that alfentanil disposition was not affected by fexofenadine. A dosing regimen was identified in which fexofenadine disposition was not affected by alfentanil.

15584957,"Although the surface waxes from Arabidopsis thaliana leaves and stems have been thoroughly characterized, the monomer composition of the polyesters of the cuticular membrane has not been analyzed. Delipidated Arabidopsis leaves or stems, when depolymerized under conditions to cleave polyesters, produced typical omega-hydroxy fatty acid cutin monomers such as 16-hydroxy-palmitate, 10,16-dihydroxy-palmitate and 18-hydroxy-9,10-epoxy-stearate. However, the major monomer was octadeca-cis-6, cis-9-diene-1,18-dioate, with lesser amounts of octadec-cis-9-ene-1,18-dioate and hexadeca-1,16-dioate. These dicarboxylates were found predominantly in epidermal peels from Arabidopsis stems and are therefore likely to be associated with the cuticular membrane. They were also found in analyses of canola leaves but were absent in tomato and apple fruit cutins. In the fad2-1 mutant line of Arabidopsis, which has reduced levels of linoleate and linolenate and elevated oleate in cytosolic phospholipids, the amount of octadeca-cis-6, cis-9-diene-1,18-dioate was 50% reduced, with a concomitant increase in octadec-cis-9-ene-1,18-dioate. In a fatb-ko line of Arabidopsis, where the availability of cytosolic palmitate is impaired, there was an 80% loss of C16 monomers and a compensating increase in C18 monomers. The presence of substantial amounts of dicarboxylates in cuticular membranes is unexpected. High amounts of aliphatic dicarboxylates are usually considered as an indicator of suberin, and are reported only as very minor components of cutin. The high level of polyunsaturation is also unusual in cuticles; saturated fatty acid monomers usually predominate, with lesser amounts of monounsaturates.

Using HPLC-ESI-MS, cryptochlorogenic acid was identified in cv. Brettacher cloudy apple juice for the first time. Commercial pectolytic enzyme preparations with different levels of secondary protease activity were tested under both oxidative and nonoxidative conditions. Without the addition of ascorbic acid, oxidation substantially decreased chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, and procyanidin B2 contents due to enzymatic browning. The content of chlorogenic acid as the major polyphenolic compound was also influenced by the composition of pectolytic enzyme preparations because the presence of secondary protease activity resulted in a rise of chlorogenic acid. The latter effect was probably due to the inhibited protein-polyphenol interactions, which prevented binding of polyphenolic compounds to the matrix, thus increasing their antioxidative potential.

Under the optimized conditions (compromise between speed and sensitivity), the narrower analytical column with a thinner film provided slightly (<1.1-fold) faster analysis of <5.5 min separation times and somewhat greater separation efficiency. However, lower detection limits for most of the tested pesticides in real extracts were achieved using the mega-bore configuration, which also provided significantly greater ruggedness of the analysis (long-term repeatability of analyte peak intensities, shapes, and retention times). Additionally, the effect of the increasing injection volume (1-5 microl) on analyte signal-to-noise ratios was evaluated.

The two polysaccharide preparations share the same structural elements of apple pectin, but the relative amounts and lengths of the neutral side chains present differ. Surface analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, contact angle measurement, and atomic force microscope (AFM) force-separation curves was used to characterize the effects on surface chemistry and interfacial forces of the surface modification process. Cell adhesion experiments using continuous L-929 fibroblasts and primary aortic smooth muscle cells were performed to evaluate the effect of the polysaccharide nature on cell adhesion. Results show that immobilization of the HR affects the interfacial field of forces and the cell behavior: ""equilibrium"" contact angles, obtained by a recently introduced vibrational approach, decrease after HR immobilization reaching a value close to 20 degrees . AFM force-separation curves show a more extended (or softer) interface in the case of the HR bearing longer side chains. Accordingly, depending on the HR preparation, cells shifted from spread morphology and adhesion behavior quantitatively comparable to that observed on conventional tissue culture polystyrene to rounded morphology and significantly lower adhesion.

Several studies suggested that apple polyphenols could play a role in prevention of degenarative diseases. The action of these compounds has been partially ascribed to their antioxidative ability, and fruit antioxidants profile is influenced by apple variety and by the postharvest storage. In this work, the polyphenols composition of the flesh of four apple varieties cultivated in southern Italy were investigated by HPLC, and a flow injection MS/MS procedure to quantify cholorogenic acid and catechins was set up. Phenolic composition and the radical scavenging activity were monitored during a postharvest storage of four months. The quantification by flow injection procedure gives results comparable to those obtained by HPLC, and the increase of the antioxidant activity during storage correlated with an increase of the concentration of catechin and phloridzin.

15287660,"A collaborative study of the carbon-13 isotope ratio mass spectrometry (13C-IRMS) method based on fermentation ethanol for detecting some sugar additions in fruit juices and maple syrup is reported. This method is complementary to the site-specific natural isotope fractionation by nuclear magnetic resonance (SNIF-NMR) method for detecting added beet sugar in the same products (AOAC Official Methods 995.17 and 2000.19), and uses the same initial steps to recover pure ethanol. The fruit juices or maple syrups are completely fermented with yeast, and the alcohol is distilled with a quantitative yield (>96%). The carbon-13 deviation (delta13C) of ethanol is then determined by IRMS. This parameter becomes less negative when exogenous sugar derived from plants exhibiting a C4 metabolism (e.g., corn or cane) is added to a juice obtained from plants exhibiting a C3 metabolism (most common fruits except pineapple) or to maple syrup. Conversely, the delta13C of ethanol becomes more negative when exogenous sugar derived from C3 plants (e.g., beet, wheat, rice) is added to pineapple products. Twelve laboratories analyzed 2 materials (orange juice and pure cane sugar) in blind duplicate and 4 sugar-adulterated materials (orange juice, maple syrup, pineapple juice, and apple juice) as Youden pairs. The precision of that method for measuring delta13C was similar to that of other methods applied to wine ethanol or extracted sugars in juices.

Apple tissue extracts were subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography separation, which showed that as compared with pulps, peels are richer in almost all of the quantified phenolics. Flavonols, flavanols, procyanidins, dihydrochalcones, and hydroxycinnamates were the identified phenolic classes in peel tissue, and the most abundant compounds were epicatechin, procyanidin B2, and phloridzin. Pulps were poorer in phytochemicals. Their major phenolics were procyanidins and hydroxycinnamates. Flavonols in amounts <20 mg kg(-1) fresh weight (fw) were also found. In both peels and pulps, integrated production samples were richer in polyphenols. Among the 14 compounds identified, only phloridzin had a tendency to appear higher in organic peels. The total antioxidant capacities (TAC) of extracts were evaluated using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical assay and were expressed as Trolox equivalents. Integrated peels gave the highest TAC (18.56 mM kg(-1) fw), followed by organic peels (TAC = 14.96), integrated pulps (TAC = 7.12), and organic pulps (TAC = 6.28). In peels, the top contributors to the antioxidant activity were found to be flavonols, flavanols, and procyanidins, which accounted for about 90% of the total calculated activity whereas in pulps, the TAC was primarily derived from flavanols (monomers and polymers) together with hydroxycinnamates.

Carbamate pesticides are known to be used on a broad spectrum of crops, including orchard and vine crops such as apples and grapes. Concern over potential exposure to these acutely toxic pesticides by infants and young children has increased in the last decade. Liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection was used to determine the concentrations of seven N-methyl carbamates and three transformation products in domestic and imported apple and grape juices collected across Canada. Carbaryl was the most frequently (58.6%) detected N-methyl carbamate in juice samples studied. It was observed more frequently in grape juices than in apple or mixed juices. Oxamyl and methomyl were detected in apple juice samples, although they were below detection limits in all grape and mixed juice samples analysed. Maximum levels of carbaryl, methomyl and oxamyl were 93, 6.7 and 4.6 ng ml(-1), respectively. All other analytes were not present in any juice sample at concentrations above the method detection limit (0.3 ng ml(-1)). In all cases, N-methyl carbamate residues were well below the maximum residue limit established for apples and grapes in the Canadian Food and Drug Regulations.

The experiments were conducted on leaves of Close and Jester apple cultivars in laboratory conditions. Leaves were treated with: 1. solution of 0.1% JA-Me in 0.05% Triton X-100 (by spraying); 2. beta-glucosidase dissolved in 0.1 M citrate buffer at pH 6 (by petiole); 3. 0.05% solution of the Triton X-100 (by spraying); 4. 0.1 M citrate buffer at pH 6 (by petiole); 5. non-treated leaves. In the no-choice test, application of JA-Me on leaves of apple trees caused reducing of number of eggs laid up during three days of the experiment. In the choice test, which was carried out for determination of non-preference mechanism of resistance, there was not significant differences between number of mites on leaves treated with JA-Me compared to leaves treated with beta-glucosidase, and to non-treated leaves after 24 hours from solutions application. However, at the same experiment, females of T. urticae laid the least number of eggs on leaves treated with JA-Me. Analysis conducted using liquid chromatography method, revealed higher level of phenolic compounds on leaves treated with JA-Me compared to check and leaves treated with beta-glucosidase.

15137810,"The performance of a commercially available microtiter plate ELISA kit for the determination of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid was evaluated for sensitivity, selectivity, influence of organic solvent used for extraction procedure, matrix interference originated from agricultural sample, accuracy, and method comparison with conventional HPLC analysis. The limit of detection for the kit (0.1 or 0.5 ng/mL) was determined. The working range (1-39 ng/mL) experimentally calculated on the basis of a criterion, which is determined as the range from I(20) to I(80), was comparable to that established by the manufacturer (1-50 ng/mL). The linearity of the standard curve based on the kit-assembled standard solutions agreed with the one based on the self-made standard solutions. Specificity studies indicate that the imidacloprid monoclonal antibody can readily distinguish the target compound from other structurally related neonicotinoid analogues and some metabolites, with the exception of clothianidin, the cross-reactivity of which was approximately 12%. To extract imidacloprid from an agricultural sample (apple) as simply and rapidly as possible, some extraction methods were examined. Consequently, the extraction method with hand-shaking for 5 min was the best among the examined methods. For the analysis of imidacloprid in apple samples, it was extracted directly with methanol and the extracts were diluted 10-fold (100-fold in the well) with water prior to ELISA analysis. No significant matrix interference was observed with the dilution factor. Recoveries of imidacloprid from fortified apple samples ranged from 87.7 to 112.0%.

We have previously characterized these two particles regarding their lipid and protein compositions, their synthesis and tissular distribution, and their contributions of energy and structural precursors for the developing embryo. In the present study, we have characterized the glycosidic moieties associated to these perivitellines. Both proteins were isolated from egg homogenates by ultracentrifugation, and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using anionic exchange and size exclusion columns. Total carbohydrates accounted for 17.8% and 2.5% (w/w) of the apparent molecular mass of ovorubin and PV2, respectively. Analysis by size exclusion chromatography showed that the amount of O-linked oligosaccharides is higher than that of the N-linked species (59% and 67% w/w of total carbohydrates of ovorubin and PV2, respectively). Glycosylation patterns were determined by a set of biotinilated lectins onto blotted purified proteins. Lectin affinities confirmed the presence of aspargine-linked carbohydrates, probably of hybrid and high mannose types. Jacaline affinity suggested the presence of O-linked residues derived from the T-antigen. Total carbohydrate composition determined by gas liquid chromatography (GLC) showed that mannose was the major monosaccharide in both perivitellins followed by GlcNAc and Gal in ovorubin, and Gal and GlcNAc in PV2.

The performance of this bienzyme electrode under batch and flow injection (FI) conditions, as well as an amperometric detection in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), are reported. The order of enzyme immobilisation atop the MPA-SAM affected the biosensor amperometric response in terms of sensitivity, with the immobilisation order GOD, FDH, TTF being selected. Similar analytical characteristics to those obtained with single GOD or FDH SAM-based biosensors for glucose and fructose were achieved with the bienzyme electrode, indicating that no noticeable changes in the biosensor responses to the analytes occurred as a consequence of the coimmobilisation of both enzymes on the same MPA-AuE. The suitability of the bienzyme biosensor for the analysis of real samples under flow injection conditions was tested by determining glucose in two certified serum samples. The simultaneous determination of glucose and fructose in the same sample cannot be performed without a separation step because at the detection potential used (+0.10 V), both sugars show amperometric response. Consequently, HPLC with amperometric detection at the TTF-FDH-GOD-MPA-AuE was accomplished. Glucose and fructose were simultaneously determined in honey, cola softdrink, and commercial apple juice, and the results were compared with those obtained by using other reference methods.","Bioelectrochemistry (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","['D015374', 'D002237', 'D020099', 'D045424', 'D004563', 'D004800', 'D005632', 'D005947', 'D005949', 'D015203', 'D012680', 'D018511']","['Biosensing Techniques', 'Carbohydrate Dehydrogenases', 'Coated Materials, Biocompatible', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Electrochemistry', 'Enzymes, Immobilized', 'Fructose', 'Glucose', 'Glucose Oxidase', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Systems Integration']",An integrated bienzyme glucose oxidase-fructose dehydrogenase-tetrathiafulvalene-3-mercaptopropionic acid-gold electrode for the simultaneous determination of glucose and fructose.,"['Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000737', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', None, None, None]","['methods', 'chemistry', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'methods', 'chemistry', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15110273,2004,0,1,monosaccharides in apple juice,apple,0.26436781609195403,"['tetrathiafulvalene', 'glucose', 'TTF-FDH-GOD-MPA-AuE', 'AuE', 'glutaraldehyde', 'TTF', 'FDH', 'MPA', 'SAM', 'fructose', 'Glucose', 'sugars', '3-mercaptopropionic acid']",1,23

15046818,"The mycotoxin patulin (PAT), which frequently occurs in apple juices, has previously been shown to be toxic and teratogenic. However, there is almost no data about its absorption and metabolism. Therefore, the enrichment of PAT in the tissue of perfused rat stomachs after luminal application and its vascular appearance was quantified by stable isotope dilution assays. After application of juices enriched with PAT at concentrations of 350 and 3.5 mg/l, respectively, the mycotoxin appeared almost instantly in the perfusate. Twenty-six to twenty-nine percent of PAT were removed from the gastric lumen over 55 min. From this quantity, 17% and 2% were transferred into vascular circulation and 3% and 0.06% were detectable in gastric tissue for the high and the low PAT dose, respectively. The disappearance of 8400 microg and 700 microg PAT, respectively, could be attributed in part to its reaction with intracellular glutathione (GSH). Regarding the GSH content in the tissue, a decrease of 87% compared to that of control stomachs was observed for the high PAT dose, whereas in the case of the low PAT dose no significant GSH degradation occurred.

15036012,"Although both non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and resistant starches (RS) are included in current definitions of dietary fibre, our previous work has suggested fundamental differences in the way in which these two classes of material affect the disposition and absorption of a dietary carcinogen. The present studies explore whether different effects on carcinogen metabolism could play a role in the contrasting patterns seen previously. Groups of female Wistar rats were pre-fed for 4 weeks one of five types of defined diet (AIN-76). The control diet contained 35% maize starch and no dietary fibre. The RS-containing diets had all the maize starch substituted with either Hi-maize or potato starch. In the NSP-containing diets, 10% of the maize starch was substituted with dietary fibre in the form of either lignified plant cell walls (wheat straw) or soluble dietary fibre (apple pectin). Pre-fed rats were gavaged with the food carcinogen, [2-14C] 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), and plasma and urinary metabolites characterized using HPLC at various time intervals after administration. After 4 h gavage, plasma from rats on both RS-containing diets contained significantly higher levels of intact IQ and lower levels of the major metabolites, IQ-5-O-glucuronide and IQ-5-sulfate, as compared with plasma from the negative control group at this time. In contrast, plasma from animals on the NSP-containing wheat straw diet (and to a lesser extent the apple pectin diet) showed significantly lower levels of intact IQ, and significantly higher levels of the two major metabolites, as compared with those from the control rats. These different metabolite profiles were also reflected in different urinary excretion profiles. Urine from rats pre-fed RS-containing diets revealed significantly slower metabolite excretion as compared with urine from rats that had been given the NSP-containing diets. Western blotting methodologies also profiled differences between the effects of these two types of dietary fibre in the expression of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. We conclude that changes in activity and expression of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes could play a role in the contrasting effects of these two types of dietary fibre on carcinogen uptake and disposition.","Journal of chromatography.

15035607,"We present an analysis of the folding behavior of the 159-residue major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1. The protein contains a water-filled channel running through it. Consequently, the protein has a hydrophobic shell, rather than a hydrophobic core. During the folding of the protein from either the urea-, pH-, or SDS-denatured state, Bet v 1 transiently populates a partially folded intermediate state. This state appears to be misfolded, since it has to unfold at least partially to fold to the native state. The misfolded intermediate is not, however, a result of the water-filled channel in Bet v 1. The intermediate completely disappears in the mutant Tyr --> Trp120, in which the channel is still present. Tyr120 appears to behave as a ""negative gatekeeper"" which attenuates efficient folding. The close structural homologue, the apple allergen Mal d 1, also folds without any detectable folding intermediates. However, the position of the transition state on the reaction coordinate, which is a measure of its overall compactness relative to the denatured and native states, is reduced dramatically from ca. 0.9 in Bet v 1 to around 0.5 in Mal d 1. We suggest that this large shift in the transition state structure is partly due to different local helix propensities. Given that individual mutations can have such large effects on folding, one should not a priori expect structurally homologous proteins to fold by the same mechanism.",Biochemistry,"['D000485', 'D000595', 'D019943', 'D052179', 'D057927', 'D007700', 'D008956', 'D008969', 'D010940', 'D017354', 'D011489', 'D017510', 'D015398', 'D013050', 'D040681', 'D013816', 'D014364', 'D014443', 'D014508']","['Allergens', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigens, Plant', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Chemical', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plant Proteins', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Protein Folding', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'Thermodynamics', 'Tryptophan', 'Tyrosine', 'Urea']",Elimination of a misfolded folding intermediate by a single point mutation.,"['Q000737', None, 'Q000235', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000235', None, None, None, 'Q000235', 'Q000235', None]","['chemistry', None, 'genetics', None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'genetics', None, None, None, 'genetics', 'genetics', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15035607,2004,1,0,Existence of apple allergen mentioned,apple,0.01694915254237288,['Tyr120'],1,1

This is the first report of the four isoforms of Himalayan mistletoe ribosome-inactivating proteins (HmRips) from Viscum album parasitized on wild apple inhabiting NW Himalayas. HmRips were purified by affinity chromatography and four isoforms were separated by ion-exchange chromatography. HmRip 1, 2, 3, and 4 have isoelectric points of 6.6, 6.1, 5.2, and 4.7, respectively. Disulfide linked toxin and lectin subunits of HmRip 1 and 2 isoforms have molecular weights of 28 and 34kDa while those of HmRip 3 and 4 have 28 and 32kDa. The isoforms lacked blood group specificity and showed positive activity with seven mammalian erythrocyte types but did not show any activity with avian erythrocyte type. Lectin activity of HmRips remained unchanged for a wide range of temperatures (0-65 degrees C) and pH (3-9). Unlike other type II Rips, the HmRip 1, 2, and 4 showed unique affinity towards l-rhamnose, meso-inositol, and l-arabinose while HmRip 3 has specificity to gal/galNAc. Sugar binding studies with 22 sugars also suggested that the C-4 hydroxyl of galactose might be the critical site involved in sugar binding of HmRips. Type II Rips are known to be galactoside specific and do not have affinity for l-rhamnose and meso-inositol.

This approach consists of extemporaneously compounding the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) into a solution or a suspension in the clinic prior to oral administration. The development consisted of physico-chemical assessment, constitution fluid selection, weighing and dosing validation, and stability evaluation of API, before and after constitution with the fluid. Of the oral liquids evaluated, apple juice was selected as the constitution fluid. Particle size of SU011248 had an impact on the weighing validation and the dissolution time. Particle size specifications of breadth d90 < 180 microm and length d90 < 750 microm were set to achieve pharmaceutical acceptability. Dosing validation studies showed complete recovery of SU011248 from the bottle over a dose range of 10 to 2200 mg. SU011248 is stable as the solid API. Following constitution with apple juice, the product is stable through the predicted duration of compounding and dosing at the clinical site.

14969513,"A simple, specific, and rapid analytical method for determining seven largely used carbamate insecticides in tomato, spinach, lettuce, zucchini, pear, and apple is here presented. This method is based on the matrix solid-phase dispersion technique, with heated water as extractant followed by liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) equipped with a single quadrupole and an electrospray ion source. Target compounds were extracted from the vegetal matrixes by water heated at 50 degrees C. After acidification and filtration, 0.25 mL of any aqueous extract was injected in the LC column. MS data acquisition was performed in the selected ion monitoring mode, selecting three ions for each target compound. Heated water appeared to be an excellent extractant because recovery data ranged between 76 (carbaryl in spinach) and 99% (pirimicarb in spinach), with RSDs not larger than 10%. Using trimethacarb (an obsolete carbamate insecticide) as a surrogate internal standard, the accuracy of the analysis varied between 84 and 110%, with RSDs not larger than 9%. On the basis of a signal-to-noise ratio of 10, limits of quantification were estimated to range between 2 (pirimicarb) and 10 ppb (oxamyl) and were not influenced by the type of matrix. When trying to fractionate analytes by using a short chromatographic run time, marked weakening of the ion signals for oxamyl, methomyl, and aldicarb were observed.

The major carotenoid was astaxanthin in its free (40%), monoester (24%), and diester (35%) forms, mainly esterified with 16:0 fatty acid.

The carotenoid-apoprotein interaction was studied by spectrophotometry and electrophoresis using reconstituted ovorubin. Astaxanthin does not seem to affect the structural characteristics of ovorubin, however the carotenoid-protein association significantly protected astaxanthin against oxidation.

14650613,"In recent years, comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC) has attained increasing attention for its outstanding separation potential and capability to solve demanding analytical tasks. Trace level analysis of pesticides residues in complex food matrices represents such a demanding task. For some commodities, such as baby food, the requirements on method detection limits are very strict and the unambiguous confirmation of the pesticide presence based on mass spectrometric detection is required. In this work, GC x GC coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF MS) has been evaluated for the determination of pesticides residues in fruit samples. Twenty modern pesticides with a broad range of physico-chemical properties were analysed in apple and peach samples. It has been demonstrated that the application of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography brings distinct advantages such as enhanced separation of target pesticides from matrix co-extracts as well as their improved detectability. The limits of detection of the pesticides comprised in the study (determined at S/N = 5) ranged from 0.2 to 30 pg, injected with the exception of the last eluted deltamethrin, for which 100 pg could be detected. When compared to one-dimentional GC-TOF MS analysis under essentially the same conditions the detectability enhancement was 1.5-50-fold. Full mass spectral information by time-of-flight mass spectrometry and the deconvolution capability of the dedicated software allowed for reliable identification of most pesticides at levels below 0.01 mg/kg (< 10 pg injected) in fruit. Performance characteristics of the GC x GC-TOF MS method, such as linearity of calibration curves, repeatability of (summed) peak areas, as well as repeatability of first and second dimension retention times, were shown to fully satisfy the requirements for trace level analysis of the pesticide residues in food.",Journal of chromatography.

14629467,"The coagulation protease zymogen factor (F)XI is a disulfide bond-linked homodimer, a configuration that is necessary for protein secretion and function. The non-catalytic portion of the FXI polypeptide contains four repeats called apple domains (A1-A4). It is clear that FXI A4 plays a key role in dimer formation, however, the importance of other apple domains to this process has not been examined. We prepared recombinant FXI molecules in which apple domains were exchanged with those of the structurally homologous monomeric protein prekallikrein (PK). As expected, FXI/PK chimeras containing FXI A4 are dimers, while those with PK A4 are monomers. FXI A4 contains cysteine at position 321 that forms the interchain disulfide bond, while Cys321 in PK is unavailable for interchain bond formation because it is paired with Cys326. FXI/PK chimeras containing PK A4 were modified by changing Cys326 to glycine, leaving Cys321 unpaired (PKA4-Gly326). FXI with a PK A4 domain is a monomer, however, introducing PKA4-Gly326 results in a disulfide bond-linked dimer. This indicates that dimer formation can occur in the absence of FXI A4. In proteins containing PKA4-Gly326, replacing FXI A3 with PK A3 partially interferes with dimer formation, while substitution of A2, or A2 and A3 prevents dimer formation. PKA4-Gly326 cannot induce the native PK molecule to dimerize. The data indicate that FXI A2 and A3 make contributions to dimer formation. As these domains are involved in activities that require dimeric protein, it seems reasonable that they stabilize this conformation.",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,"['D001665', 'D002850', 'D003001', 'D019281', 'D004220', 'D004591', 'D005164', 'D006801', 'D011288', 'D017434', 'D011993']","['Binding Sites', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Dimerization', 'Disulfides', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Factor IX', 'Humans', 'Prekallikrein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins']",Factor XI apple domains and protein dimerization.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000737', None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'chemistry', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14629467,2004,0,0,Factor XI apple domains,apple,0.07692307692307693,"['glycine', 'PK A3', 'cysteine', 'PK', 'FXI A3', 'Cys321']",1,6

When viewed by electron microscopy, cbeta2m aggregates appear as elongated unbranched fibers, the morphology typical for amyloids. Cbeta2m fibers stain with Congo red and show apple-green birefringence in polarized light, characteristic of amyloids.

The use of sodium acetate was new and key to the near baseline separation of 25 phenolics commonly found in fruits. A photodiode array detector was used and data were collected at four wavelengths (280, 320, 360, and 520 nm). This method was sensitive and gave good separation of polyphenolics in apple, cherry, strawberry, blackberry, grape, apple juice, and a processing by-product. The improved separation has led to better understanding of the polyphenolic profiles of these fruits. Individual as well as total phenolic content was obtained, and the latter was close to and correlated well with that obtained by the Folin-Ciocalteu method (FC).

The aim of the study was to examine whether it was possible to generate a unique elemental fingerprint of individual barley genotypes irrespective of the elemental imprint plants had received from soils differing in fertility and agricultural practice. Multivariate statistics were used to analyze the elemental fingerprints of the barley genotypes at different times during a full growing season from early tillering to full maturity of the barley grains. Initially, 36 elements were analyzed in the plant samples but this number was subsequently reduced to 15 elements: B, Ba, C, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, N, Na, P, S, Sr, and Zn. These elements exceeded the limit of detection ( LOD) for all genotypes, soil types, and plant growth stages and for these elements the accuracy was better than 90% compared with apple leaf certified reference material (CRM). Principal component analysis (PCA) separated multi-elemental data in accordance with soil type when plants of similar physiological age were compared, whereas this separation disappeared if plants of all ages were compared simultaneously. Isotope ratios (delta(15)N) of plants also proved to be a highly accurate property for classification of samples according to soil type. In contrast, the differences in delta(13)C were too small to enable such classification. The differences in delta(15)N among soils were so pronounced that separation of samples according to the physiological age of plants became redundant. However, delta(15)N and the multi-elemental analysis revealed no differences between the three barley genotypes, indicating that the influence of soil chemistry and possibly also climate and agricultural practice was too large to allow an unique elemental fingerprint for the genotypes. This finding was substantiated by analyzing the multi-elemental composition of grain from two additional genotypes (Otira and Barthos) grown at the north and east locations, respectively. PCA showed not only that the elemental fingerprints of these two genotypes were similar to those of the others, but also that the soil in which the plant had been growing could be accurately predicted on the basis of the PCA scores from the genotypes Orthega, Barke, and Bartok.

14521223,"To assess the UV-screening capacity of plant surface structures, the optical properties of isolated cuticle and detached peel of apple fruit (Malus domestica Borkh., cv. Antonovka) have been studied. It was found that the cuticle exhibits considerable scattering of UV radiation, negligible absorption between 500-800 nm and attenuates UV radiation: on average, cuticular transmittance of non-reflected light amounts to 35.7 +/- 20.2 and 14.2 +/- 7.1% at 375 and 300 nm, respectively. The principal UV-A absorbers in the cuticle were identified as quercetin glycosides with an in vivo absorption maximum near 375 nm and content ranging from 10 to 70 nmol cm(-2). On the shaded side of apple fruit, both UV-A and UV-B absorption by the peel is, to a large extent, governed by cuticular phenolics, whereas on the sunlit surface, the absorption of the peel in the UV-A range is determined mainly by vacuolar peel flavonoids.

12963711,"Recombinant sericin proteins of different molecular masses (17.4, 31.9, and 46.5 kDa), based on the 38-amino acid repetitive motif of native sericin, were cloned, expressed, and purified. The recombinant sericin self-assembled during dialysis (starting concentration of 2.5 mg/ml) forming twisted fibers. Circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies demonstrated protein conformational transitions occurred from random coil to beta-sheets during the dialysis. Congo red-stained recombinant sericin fibrils exhibited apple-green birefringence, indicating long-range order in the array of beta-sheets. Biosynthetic sericin has a high content of polar amino acids (e.g. > 40 mol % serine), leading to a beta-sheet conformation formed by hydrogen bonding via polar zipper interactions. Analysis of recombinant sericin sequence using Mandel-Gutfreund's (Mandel-Gutfreund, Y., and Gregoret, L. M. (2002) J. Mol. Biol. 323, 453-461) definition of polar and non-polar amino acids showed that the hydrophobicity pattern resembles the most frequent pattern of amyloidogenic proteins, polar amino acid aggregates (PPPPP). Many beta-proteins and peptides are designed to study amyloidogenesis using a polar/non-polar alternating pattern (PNPNPN). Sericin-like proteins or peptides provide an alternative model in terms of hydrophobicity pattern with which to explore questions related to beta-sheet formation and amyloidogenesis.

12956512,"A high quality of mass reared parasitoids is required for successful biological control of pest insects. Although the phenomenon of behavioral deterioration of parasitoids due to rearing in artificial conditions is well known, its significance is often underestimated, and the underlying mechanisms are poorly investigated. We quantified behavioral alterations of parasitoids reared in an artificial system vs. a natural system and elucidated some of the mechanisms involved. The model systems consisted of apple fruits (natural system) or an artificial diet devoid of apple (artificial system), the herbivore Cydia pomonella, and its larval parasitoid Hyssopus pallidus, a candidate biological control agent. Two parasitoid strains, one reared for 30 generations in the natural system and one in the artificial system, were compared by using the females' ability to respond to frass from codling moth caterpillars fed on apple fruits (apple-frass). The searching response of parasitoids reared in the artificial system compared to those reared in the natural system was reduced by an average of 53.2%. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses of the two types of caterpillars' food and of the two corresponding types of frass showed that 15 compounds were present only in apple fruits and apple-frass, three compounds only in artificial diet and artificial-diet-frass, while four compounds were present in both frass types but not in the food sources. This suggests the presence of a food-derived and a host-derived component in the frass. Results from both bioassays and chemical analyses indicate that the kairomonal activity of the frass is due to both apple fruit and host components. The reduced response of parasitoids reared in artificial conditions might, therefore, be due to a lack of recognition of the apple fruit component. In a further experiment, the two parasitoid strains were reared in the opposite system for one generation. While the response to the host frass was significantly reduced in parasitoids that emerged from the artificial system, it was fully restored in parasitoids that emerged from the natural system. This indicates that the behavioral alteration was related to a learning process during ontogenesis rather than to a selection exhibited over generations.",Journal of chemical ecology,"['D000821', 'D000818', 'D018797', 'D004258', 'D004259', 'D004032', 'D005106', 'D005247', 'D008401', 'D006790', 'D006927', 'D007300', 'D007814', 'D007858', 'D027845', 'D009036', 'D029701']","['Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'DNA Polymerase III', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Diet', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Hymenoptera', 'Insect Control', 'Larva', 'Learning', 'Malus', 'Moths', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins']",Mechanisms of behavioral alterations of parasitoids reared in artificial systems.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000472', None, None, None, None, 'Q000502', None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'pathogenicity', None, None, None, None, 'physiology', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12956512,2004,0,0,parasite control,apple,0.031914893617021274,['apple fruits'],1,3

Superdex G75 gel filtration chromatography identified a higher molecular weight (HMW) papain inhibitory fraction (22-26 kDa) and a lower molecular weight papain and trypsin inhibitory fraction (6-12 kDa). The lower molecular weight fraction was separated into a trypsin inhibitor (designated Trp1) and early (designated Pap1) and late (designated Pap2) eluting papain inhibitors after anion exchange (Hitrap SP) chromatography. For Pap2, two inhibitory peaks (designated Pap2-1 and Pap2-2) were identified after further anion exchange (Resource S) chromatography. Each of these lower molecular weight inhibitors was purified by reverse phase HPLC to homogeneity as determined by SDS-PAGE and by mass spectrometry. The HMW papain inhibitory fraction was purified further by anion-exchange (Hitrap Q followed by Resource Q) column chromatography where a minor inhibitor (HMWPap1) and major inhibitor (HMWPap2) fraction were identified. The relative abundance in seeds of apple and the spectrum of proteinase inhibition has been determined for all of these inhibitors.

12860024,"A pilot study was performed to prove the suitability of stable isotope dilution assays for assessing the bioavailability of endogenous folates in foods. By using [2H(4)]folic acid, [2H(4)]tetrahydrofolate, [2H(4)]5-methyltetrahydrofolate, [2H(4)]5-formyltetrahydrofolate and [2H(4)]10-formylfolic acid as internal standards, folates in spinach, apple juice and blood plasma were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. To liberate the pteroyl monoglutamates, sample extracts of foods were treated by rat plasma. Sample clean-up was achieved by solid-phase extraction on anion-exchange cartridges, which proved to be sufficient to obtain mass chromatograms devoid of matrix interferences. The bioavailability study was designed as a short-time protocol with three meals, the first consisting of 600 g spinach (meal A), the second consisting of 600 g apple sauce with additionally 400 microg synthetic folic acid (meal B) and the third consisting solely of 600 g apple sauce (meal C). Prior to the meals, the participating volunteer's tissue was saturated with folates to achieve a significant response of plasma folate to the meals. After consumption of meals A and B a significant rise in folate plasma level compared to meal C (mean level at 28 microg/ml) was observed. The relative bioavailability of folate following meal A exceeded significantly the suggested value of 50% for food folates by taking the dose-normalized area under the curve (AUC) following ingestion of meal B as reference.","Journal of chromatography.

12787673,"Mal d 2 is a thaumatin-like protein and important allergen of apple fruits that is associated with IgE-mediated symptoms in apple allergic individuals. We obtained a full-length cDNA clone of Mal d 2 from RNA isolated from ripe apple (Malus domestica cv. Golden Delicious). The cDNA's open reading frame encodes a protein of 246 amino acid residues including a signal peptide of 24 residues and two putative glycosylation sites. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature Mal d 2 protein results in a predicted molecular mass of 23,210.9Da and a calculated pI of 4.55. Sequence comparisons and molecular modeling place Mal d 2 among those pathogenesis-related thaumatin-like proteins that contain a conserved acidic cleft. In order to ensure the correct formation of the protein's eight conserved disulfide bridges we expressed Mal d 2 in Nicotiana benthamiana plants by the use of a tobacco mosaic viral vector. Transfected N.benthamiana plants accumulated Mal d 2 to levels of at least 2% of total soluble protein. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analyses of the recombinant Mal d 2 and its proteolytic fragments showed that the apple-specific leader peptide was correctly cleaved off by the host plant and that the mature recombinant protein was intact and not glycosylated. Purified recombinant Mal d 2 displayed the ability to bind IgE from apple-allergic individuals equivalent to natural Mal d 2.

Belgian (n = 29) and imported (14) apple juices as well as ciders (7) were assayed for PAT by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet light detection. PAT was detected respectively in 79, 86 and 43% of these tested samples. However, no contaminated sample exceeded the safe level of 50 microg PAT l(-1). Levels of PAT contamination were comparable in Belgian and imported juice samples. The overall mean PAT concentrations were 9.0 and 3.4 microg l(-1) for contaminated apple juices and ciders, respectively. This study also indicates that there was no statistically significant difference in the mean PAT contamination between clear (7.8 microg l(-1)) and cloudy (10.7 microg l(-1)) apple juices, as well as between handicraft-made apple juices (14.6 microg l(-1)) and industrial ones (7.0 microg l(-1)).

Roseotoxin chromatographic profiles from these two experiments were compared. Product-ion collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra obtained on an ion trap (electrospray ionisation, ESI) were used for the identification of natural roseotoxins A, B, C and of minor destruxins A and B. The dissociation behavior of roseotoxins is discussed in terms of a fragmentation scheme proposed for describing the dissociation pathways of cyclic peptides. This scheme involves opening of the cyclopeptide ring via formation of oxazolone derivatives and fragmentation of the resulting linear species, which have a free N-terminus and an oxazolone ring at the C-terminus. Some aspects of this fragmentation scheme are underlined by modeling the dissociation channels of roseotoxin A using quantum chemical calculations. The structures of roseotoxin A and destruxin B were verified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Structures of three new minor natural roseotoxins [Val(4)]RosA, [MeLxx(4)]RosA and [MeLxx(4)]RosB were deduced by ion cyclotron resonance Fourier transform mass spectrometry (ICR-FT-MS) and ion trap tandem mass spectrometry by examining the pre-separated roseotoxin fraction.","European journal of mass spectrometry (Chichester, England)","['D002851', 'D047630', 'D009682', 'D013058', 'D003904', 'D015394', 'D010456']","['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Depsipeptides', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mitosporic Fungi', 'Molecular Structure', 'Peptides, Cyclic']",Profiling of cyclic hexadepsipeptides roseotoxins synthesized in vitro and in vivo: a combined tandem mass spectrometry and quantum chemical study.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032']","[None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12748394,2003,0,0,toxins,apple,0.14285714285714285,"['Trichothecium', 'Roseotoxins', 'roseotoxins', 'cyclic peptides', 'cyclic hexadepsipeptides roseotoxins', 'oxazolone', 'roseotoxins A']",1,9

Environmental samples were taken from soil and surface waters in Hungary. The ELISA enabled fenoxycarb detection in surface waters in the 1.1-125 ng ml(-1) concentration range without sample cleanup. In contrast, soil produced a strong matrix effect due to humic acids and other soil components. Several fruit homogenates and commercial fruit juices (eg apple, pear, grape) were analyzed by the ELISA. The assay was found to be suitable for analysis of fenoxycarb in fruit juices diluted 1:40. Biological samples included insect, fish and bovine tissues. The ELISA was applied to detect fenoxycarb in various biological matrices from larvae of the silkworm, Bombyx mori L. The assay proved useful for the analysis of haemolymph diluted 1:10 or at higher dilutions. Fat body and whole body homogenates, however, caused severe matrix effects. Fenoxycarb was detected in liver homogenates (diluted 1:40) from fish treated with various doses of fenoxycarb, and the concentrations determined correlated with the applied doses.

12661763,"A beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) from peach (Prunus persica cv Mibackdo) was purified and characterized. The purified peach beta-galactosidase was 42 kDa in molecular mass and showed high enzyme activity against a the beta-galactosidase substrate, rho-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside. The Km and Vmax values of the enzyme activity of the peach beta-galactosidase were 5.16 and 0.19 mM for rho-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside mM/h, respectively. The optimum pH of the enzyme activity was pH 3.0, but it was relatively stable from pH 3.0-10.0. The temperature optimum was 50 degrees C. The enzyme activities were not improved in the buffers that contained Ca2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Mg2+, which indicates that the purified peach beta-galactosidase did not require these cations as co-factors. However, the enzyme was completely inhibited by Hg2+. The purified protein was cross-reacted with an antibody against the persimmon fruit beta-galactosidase. A further comparison of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein showed high homologies to those of beta-galactosidase in apple (87%), persimmon (80%), and tomato (87%).

Between drought stressed and control trees, no significant differences were observed in concentration of ZR and DHZR in both leafless and leafy trees; whereas iPA concentration of the drought stressed leafless and leafy plants decreased markedly in the later stage of drought.

Isotopic techniques are commonly used to identify the addition of low cost sugars to fruit juices and are difficult to circumvent as it is not economically viable to change the isotopic ratios of the sugars. The procedure utilizes the derivative hexamethylenetetramine, which is produced through chemical transformation of a sugar degradation product and provides position-specific (13)C and (2)H ratios that relate to the parent sugar molecule. The new procedure has advantages over methods using nitro-sugar derivatives in terms of analysis time and sensitivity.

Using a mixed micellar SC-SDS system (50 mM phosphate at pH 7 containing 40 mM SC and 10 mM SDS), it is possible to separate these compounds in less than 15 min.

12517106,"Eight freshly distilled samples of Calvados, a fermented and distilled apple juice, were analyzed by sensory evaluation and direct injection GC to determine the composition of higher alcohols, esters, and aldehydes. The composition determined by direct injection was tentatively related to sensory descriptors. Esters have a probable maximum level around 500 g/hl of pure alcohol (PA). This level also corresponds to the threshold of the main ester constituent, ethyl acetate. A high ratio of esters to ethyl acetate seems to be of prime importance for good quality. Total aldehydes, with a maximum level between 8 and 11 g/hl of PA and mainly comprising acetal (maximum between 5 and 9 g/hl of PA), were related to a ""green"" descriptor. Higher alcohols do not have a direct impact on quality, but other volatile compounds with a positive impact on flavor should probably be present at a high level. As overall quality was not well related to sensory quality, it was necessary to perform more a precise analysis to determine the key odorants. The Calvados samples were thus extracted using pentane. Gas chromatography, employing both a flame ionization detector and an olfactometry port, was used to analyze the obtained extracts. Seventy-one odors were detected and distributed according to Calvados quality determined by sensory evaluation. Nineteen odors common to all Calvados samples constituted the ""skeleton"" of the aroma. Twenty-eight odors were specific to a quality class: 6 for good quality, 4 for neutral, and 18 for defective.

Tree-rings of a 350+ year old mammoth ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) were analyzed for element concentration and evaluated versus local and global historical events. The ponderosa pine was located 100 miles south of the Canada/USA border and 180 miles east of the Pacific Ocean, and grew near apple orchards, a public road, and Swakane Creek in western Washington, USA. The elements tested did not all display the same time versus concentration patterns. Copper and chromium displayed cyclic concentration patterns over the last 350+ years, which appear to be associated with local events. Strontium, barium, zinc and cadmium were found to be relatively constant between the mid 1600s and the early 1800s. Strontium, barium, zinc, and cadmium then increased beginning in the early 1800s for approximately 50 years then decreased to present day 2000.

12428978,"We have investigated the inhibitory effects of polyphenols from natural products, such as green tea, bilberry, grape, ginkgo, and apple, on rainbow trout gelatinase activities. Gelatinases from the skin, muscle, and blood of rainbow trout contained serine proteinase, metalloproteinase, and other proteinase activities as measured by gelatin zymography. The polyphenols of green tea caused the strong inhibition of some gelatinase activities when compared with those of the other products. This inhibition was quite similar to that of metalloproteinase by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, suggesting that the effects of green tea polyphenols on proteinase activities are specific for metalloproteinases. The major catechins of green tea polyphenols were then separated and identified by reverse-phase chromatography to be (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (-)-epigallocatechin, (-)-epicatechin gallate, and (-)-epicatechin.

12374416,"A collaborative study was conducted to determine multiple pesticide residues in apple, green bean, and carrot by using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Seventeen laboratories from 7 countries participated in the final study, and a variety of different instruments was used by collaborators. The procedure simply entails 3 steps: (1) mix 1.1 g drying agent (Hydromatrix) per 1 g frozen precomminuted sample, and load 4-5.5 g of this mixture into a 7-10 mL extraction vessel; (2) perform SFE for 20-30 min with a 1-2 mL/min flow rate of carbon dioxide at 0.85 g/mL density (320 atm, 60 degrees C); and (3) inject the extract, which was collected on a solid-phase or in a liquid trap, into the gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, using either an ion-trap instrument in full-scan mode or a quadrupole-type instrument in selected-ion monitoring mode. The ability of GC/MS to simultaneously quantitate and confirm the identity of the semivolatile analytes at trace concentrations is a strong feature of the approach. The selectivity of SFE and GC/MS avoids the need for post-extraction cleanup steps, and the conversion of the CO2 solvent to a gas after SFE eliminates the solvent evaporation step common in traditional methods. The approach has several advantages, but its main drawback is the lower recoveries for the most polar analytes, such as methamidophos and acephate, and the most nonpolar analytes, such as pyrethroids. Recoveries for most pesticides are >75%, and recoveries of nonpolar analytes are still >50%. The (within-laboratory) repeatability relative standard deviation (RSDr) values of the recoveries are generally <15%. More specifically, the average results from the 9-14 laboratories in the final analysis of 6 blind duplicates at 3 concentrations for each pesticide are as follows: carbofuran in apple (75-500 ng/g), 89% recovery, 7% RSDr, 9% reproducibility relative standard deviation (RSDR); diazinon in apple (60-400 ng/g), 83% recovery, 13% RSDr, 17% RSDR; vinclozolin in apple (6-400 ng/g), 97% recovery, 13% RSDr, 18% RSDR; chlorpyrifos in apple (50-300 ng/g), 105% recovery, 11% RSDr, 13% RSDR; endosulfan sulfate in apple (150-1000 ng/g), 95% recovery, 15% RSDr, 17% RSDR; trifluralin in green bean (30-200 ng/g), 58% recovery, 11% RSDr, 27% RSDR; dacthal in green bean (60-400 ng/g), 88% recovery, 11% RSDr, 17% RSDR; quintozene in green bean (60-400 ng/g), 79% recovery, 13% RSDr, 18% RSDR; chlorpyrifos in green bean (50-300 ng/g), 84% recovery, 11% RSDr, 17% RSDR; p,p'-DDE in green bean (45-300 ng/g), 64% recovery, 14% RSDr, 27% RSDR; atrazine in carrot (75-500 ng/g), 90% recovery, 11% RSDr, 15% RSDR; metalaxyl in carrot (75-500 ng/g), 89% recovery, 8% RSDr, 12% RSDR; parathion-methyl in carrot (75-500 ng/g), 84% recovery, 14% RSDr, 15% RSDR; chlorpyrifos in carrot (50-300 ng/g), 77% recovery, 13% RSDr, 19% RSDR; and bifenthrin in carrot (90-600 ng/g), 63% recovery, 12% RSDr, and 25% RSDR.

12221219,"Folate catabolism represents the major route of folate turnover in humans and involves cleavage of the C9-N10 bond producing a pterin and para-aminobenzoylglutamate (pABG).

Extraction of each sample with acetonitrile was followed by a salting-out step using a graduated cylinder. The test solution was cleaned up with gel permeation chromatography (GPC), which separated the pesticide eluate into 2 fractions, and then with a tandem mini-column. Analysis was done with a dual-column GC equipped with a dual NPD and FPD (S mode) detector. Use of the Siltek-deactivated liner, guard column, and Y connector, and Silcosteel-treated NPD jet was effective for preventing the breakdown of sulfur-containing pesticides. Recoveries of 87 nitrogen-containing and sulfur-containing pesticides from fortified spinach, tomato, apple, strawberry and brown rice, ranged from 71 to 127% with RSD values of 1-24%, except for recoveries of aldicarb, amitraz, ethiofencarb, imazalil, propamocarb and triflumizole. Detection limits of pesticides were very good (0.3-5 ppb (NPD) and 2-20 ppb (FPD)) for routine analysis of pesticide residues in foods. Surveillance of pesticides in agricultural products was carried out by using the present method. From 22 out of 33 samples, 21 pesticides (43 in total) were detected.

12084014,"Human factor XI, a plasma glycoprotein required for normal haemostasis, is a homodimer (160 kDa) formed by a single interchain disulphide bond linking the Cys-321 of each Apple 4 domain. Bovine, porcine and murine factor XI are also disulphide-linked homodimers. Rabbit factor XI, however, is an 80 kDa polypeptide on non-reducing SDS/PAGE, suggesting that rabbit factor XI exists and functions physiologically either as a monomer, as does prekallikrein, a structural homologue to factor XI, or as a non-covalent homodimer. We have investigated the structure and function of rabbit factor XI to gain insight into the relation between homodimeric structure and factor XI function. Characterization of the cDNA sequence of rabbit factor XI and its amino acid translation revealed that in the rabbit protein a His residue replaces the Cys-321 that forms the interchain disulphide linkage in human factor XI, explaining why rabbit factor XI is a monomer in non-reducing SDS/PAGE. On size-exclusion chromatography, however, purified plasma rabbit factor XI, like the human protein and unlike prekallikrein, eluted as a dimer, demonstrating that rabbit factor XI circulates as a non-covalent dimer. In functional assays rabbit factor XI and human factor XI behaved similarly. Both monomeric and dimeric factor XI were detected in extracts of cells expressing rabbit factor XI. We conclude that the failure of rabbit factor XI to form a covalent homodimer due to the replacement of Cys-321 with His does not impair its functional activity because it exists in plasma as a non-covalent homodimer and homodimerization is an intracellular process.",The Biochemical journal,"['D000595', 'D000818', 'D002845', 'D003001', 'D003545', 'D018076', 'D019281', 'D004591', 'D005172', 'D006801', 'D007700', 'D008969', 'D011288', 'D011817', 'D020133', 'D017386', 'D013997']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Chromatography', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cysteine', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Dimerization', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Factor XI', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Prekallikrein', 'Rabbits', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Time Factors']",Molecular cloning and biochemical characterization of rabbit factor XI.,"[None, None, None, None, 'Q000737', 'Q000378', None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, 'chemistry', 'metabolism', None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12084014,2003,0,0,"factor XI, a plasma glycoprotein",apple,0.013513513513513514,['amino acid'],1,1

Granny Smith apples were surface sterilized with 76% ethanol and inoculated with 0.1 ml of a 1.1 x 10(7) spore/ml P. expansum spore suspension. The apples were packaged either in polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP) and treated with three different gas combinations, viz., 58% CO2/42% N2, 48% CO2/52% N2, and 88% CO2/12% N2, and were then incubated for 14 days at 25 degrees C. Fungal growth was monitored every 2 to 4 days by measuring radial growth from the point of inoculation. After the 14th day, apples were pulped, and patulin was extracted, purified, and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. PP did not inhibit fungal growth in any of the atmospheres tested, and it only inhibited patulin production in atmospheric gas and 58% CO2/42% N2. PE was very effective and inhibited fungal growth by four- or fivefold, depending on the modified atmosphere. Patulin production in PE-packaged apples was almost completely inhibited by all three gas combinations. Gas chromatographic analysis of the PE-packaged samples before and after the incubation period showed that CO2 levels dropped and N2 levels increased for all of the atmospheres tested.

An unknown peak was monitored displaying the same retention time as isorhamnetin 3-O-glucoside. Preliminary identification of the isorhamnetin aglycone was performed by comparison of UV spectral data of the unknown compound with a reference substance. Using atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode, the presence of an isorhamnetin glycoside was supported by loss of 162 amu from the pseudomolecular ion (m/z 477). MS2 product ion analysis of the parent ion m/z 477 provided a fragmentation pattern identical to the reference. Collision-induced dissociation of the aglycone (m/z 315) in the MS3 product ion analysis allowed the differentiation of rhamnetin and isorhamnetin, and unambiguous assignment by comparison with standard compounds.

Thus, it is important to have a clear idea of the major phenolic families of which fruit and vegetables are comprised and the levels contained therein. Regularly consumed fruit and vegetables of mixed varieties available on the UK market were analysed for the composition of the major individual phenolic components. The total phenolic content (applying the Folin assay) and the vitamin C levels were also determined. The antioxidant capacities of aqueous/methanolic extracts were comparatively assessed using the TEAC (Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity), the FRAP (Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma) and ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) assays, which comprise contributions from polyphenols, simple phenols and the ascorbate component. The results were calculated in terms of 100 g fresh weight (FW) uncooked portion sizes. Fruit and vegetables rich in anthocyanins (e.g. strawberry, raspberry and red plum) demonstrated the highest antioxidant activities, followed by those rich in flavanones (e.g. orange and grapefruit) and flavonols (e.g. onion, leek, spinach and green cabbage), while the hydroxycinnamate-rich fruit (e.g. apple, tomato, pear and peach) consistently elicited the lower antioxidant activities.

Although the potential antimutagenic and antioxidant properties of this commercial preparation have been demonstrated, limited information is available on its digestion and absorption by humans. Stability of SCC was examined during simulated gastric and small intestinal digestion. Three preparations were subjected to in vitro digestion: SCC in water, SCC in water + 10% corn oil, and SCC in applesauce. SCC components from raw material preparations and in digested samples were analyzed by C(18) HPLC with photodiode array detection. Cu(II)chlorin e(4), the major chlorin component of SCC, was relatively stable during simulated digestion. In contrast, greater than 90% of Cu(II)chlorin e(6) was degraded to undetermined products during digestion. Recovery of Cu(II)chlorin e(6) after digestion was increased by incorporation of SCC into applesauce, suggesting a protective role of the inclusion matrix for stabilization of labile SCC components. Accumulation of SCC derivatives was investigated by using differentiated cultures of the TC7 clone of the Caco-2 human intestinal cell line. Cellular accumulation from media containing 0.5 to 60 ppm SCC was linear with intracellular content ranging between 0.2 and 29.6 microg of total SCC per mg of cellular protein.

11606193,"We investigated the biochemical function of the birch pollen allergen Bet v 6 and its role in the IgE-cross-reactivity between birch pollen and plant foods, and characterized Pyr c 5, a Bet v 6-related food allergen, from pear; the proteins were expressed as His-Tag fusion proteins in Eschershia coli and purified by Ni-chelate affinity chromatography under native conditions. Nonfusion proteins were obtained by factor Xa protease treatment. The highest degree of amino-acid sequence identity of Pyr c 5 and Bet v 6 was found with a plant protein related to a defense mechanism, which we have named phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductase (PCBER) based on its ability to catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of 8-5' linked lignans such as dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol to give isodihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol. Enzymatic assays with recombinant Pyr c 5 and Bet v 6 showed PCBER catalytic activity for both recombinant allergens.

11599982,"Dithiocarbamates are a class of fungicides extensively used in many crops worldwide. The current residue definition of dithiocarbamates in food for compliance with maximum residue limits, at national and international levels, is total residues arising from the use of any or each dithiocarbamate fungicide, determined as CS(2). The analytical method most frequently used to analyze dithiocarbamate residues in food for monitoring purposes was proposed more than 30 years ago. In this method, total dithiocarbamates are decomposed to CS(2), which is purified and reacted with a cupric reagent. The yellow complex formed is quantified by spectrophotometry. In this paper, a new reaction system for the purification and complexation of CS(2) is proposed.

Three strobilurins, azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl and trifloxystrobin were validated on three matrices, wheat, apple and grapes. The validation was based on recovery tests at three or four spiking levels, determined as double determinations and repeated three times (n = 6). The mean recoveries for the three detectors were in the range of 70-114%, and the LODs were between 0.004 mg/kg and 0.014 mg/kg, for all three strobilurins. The values for repeatability and reproducibility were within the limits for repeatability and reproducibility given by the Horwitz equation.

Free morphine, total morphine, and 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) concentrations were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in 87 medical examiner cases over 20 months. The mean total morphine concentration, mean free morphine concentration, and mean percent free morphine for all cases were: 2.3 mg/L (SD 5.2 mg/L), 0.5 mg/L (SD 1.6 mg/L), and 19.4% (SD 22.8%); respectively. Regression analyses showed weak correlations between total and free morphine concentrations over the entire concentration range (0 to 36.6 m/L, r = 0.603, n = 91) and over a subset concentration range of 0 to 1.0 mg/L (r = 0.369, n = 54). Twenty-three out of 56 (41%) tested positive for 6-MAM, indicative heroin abuse cases. Lower total and free morphine concentrations and a higher percent free morphine were found in individuals with detectable 6-MAM. Comparing blood concentrations for cases with and without detectable 6-MAM demonstrated mean total morphine concentrations of 0.9 mg/L versus 2.1 mg/L (p = 0.05), mean free morphine concentrations of 0.3 mg/L versus 0.4 mg/L (p = 0.21), and mean percent free morphine of 34.7% versus 13.7% (p < 0.003), respectively.

Gala apples were noted to have an unusual, broad absorbance maximum at approximately 258 nm, which led us to isolate and identify the primary UV-absorbing compounds. Column and thin-layer chromatography yielded a fraction that gave a series of paired, 260-nm-absorbing peaks on C(18) HPLC. These were shown to be a family of phenolic fatty acid esters, for which retention times increased with increasing fatty acid chain length, and paired peaks were esters of two related phenolics with the same fatty acid moiety. Alkaline hydrolysis of the esters released two water-soluble phenolics separable by C(18) HPLC. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry gave a molecular mass of 150 for both, and (1)H NMR plus UV absorbance spectra identified them as E and Z isomers of p-coumaryl alcohol. Alkaline cleavage of the fatty acid esters in the presence of methanol or ethanol resulted in partial derivatization of E-p-coumaryl alcohol to the corresponding gamma-O-methyl or O-ethyl ether. Gradient HMQC NMR of the HPLC-purified stearate ester of E-p-coumaryl alcohol indicated that fatty acid esterification occurs at the gamma-OH rather than at the 4-OH on the phenyl ring.

11510663,"Patulin is a mycotoxin produced by a number of molds involved in fruit spoilage. This compound is carcinogenic and teratogenic. Various methods are currently used to reduce the levels of patulin in apple juice, namely, charcoal treatment, chemical preservation (sulfur dioxide), gamma irradiation, fermentation, and trimming of fungus-infected apples. Many of these processes are expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a need to find a convenient and economical process to control patulin levels. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of several clarification processes for the reduction of patulin. Clarification was carried out on a laboratory scale. Apple pulp was spiked with patulin, pressed, and clarified using four different processes, namely, fining with bentonite, enzyme (pectinase) treatment, paper filtration, and centrifugation. Patulin was recovered from the clarified juice by liquid-liquid extraction, and solid-phase chromatography was used for sample clean-up prior to analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The minimum detectable limit using HPLC was 20 microg/liter. Pressing followed by centrifugation resulted in an average toxin reduction of 89%. Total toxin reduction using filtration, enzyme treatment, and fining were 70, 73, and 77%, respectively. Patulin reduction was due to the binding of the toxin to solid substrates that was verified by analyzing the clarified juice as well as the filter cake, pellet, and sediment. The combined concentrations correlated to the spiked concentration. These results reveal that clarification was successful in the reduction of patulin levels in apple juice.

Two types of haptens, the acid moiety that is the hydrolyzed product of flucythrinate, and the carboxylated propyl derivative of the alcohol moiety, were used to prepare monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Five MAbs, which raised against the former hapten, were reactive with flucythrinate. Among them, MAb F1A27-4 showed the highest activity toward flucythrinate, and did not cross-react with other pyrethroids such as cycloprothrin, fenvalerate, fluvalinate, etofenprox and silafluofen. The assay conditions of indirect competitive ELISA with MAb F1A27-4 were studied to optimize the detection of flucythrinate in environmental and food samples. Incubation at 4 degrees C in the assay buffer, pH 8, with 300 mM sodium chloride improved the sensitivity.

Cellular absorption was generally low, but depended noticeably on plant species, substance and enantiomer. Portions of non-extractable residues ranged from 0.1% to 1.2% of applied 14C. Amounts of soluble metabolites resulting from glufosinate or L-glufosinate were between 0.0% and 26.7% of absorbed 14C in non-transgenic cultures and 28.2% and 59.9% in transgenic sugarbeet. D-Glufosinate, MPP and N-acetyl L-glufosinate proved to be stable. The main metabolite in transgenic sugarbeet was N-acetyl L-glufosinate, besides traces of MPP and 4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)butanoic acid (MPB). In non-transgenic sugarbeet, glufosinate was transformed to a limited extent to MPP and trace amounts of MPB. In carrot, D stramonium and D purpurea, MPP was also the main product; MPB was identified as a further trace metabolite in D stramonium and D purpurea.",Pest management science,"['D000613', 'D002478', 'D019663', 'D002851', 'D013286', 'D018552', 'D004070', 'D006540', 'D019684', 'D030821', 'D010946', 'D010947']","['Aminobutyrates', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chenopodiaceae', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Datura stramonium', 'Daucus carota', 'Digitalis', 'Herbicides', 'Magnoliopsida', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Plants, Medicinal', 'Plants, Toxic']","Metabolism of the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium in plant cell cultures of transgenic (rhizomania-resistant) and non-transgenic sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris), carrot (Daucus carota), purple foxglove (Digitalis purpurea) and thorn apple (Datura stramonium).","['Q000737', None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', 'Q000737', 'Q000378', 'Q000378', None, None]","['chemistry', None, 'metabolism', None, 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', 'chemistry', 'metabolism', 'metabolism', None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11455632,2001,0,0,thorn apple,apple,0.36363636363636365,"['herbicide glufosinate-ammonium', 'D-Glufosinate', 'N-acetyl L-glufosinate', '14C', 'acid', 'Digitalis purpurea', 'enantiomer', 'MPB', 'Datura stramonium', 'glufosinate', 'D stramonium', 'L-glufosinate', 'D-glufosinate', 'racemic', 'D purpurea']",1,24
11454256,"Among all fruits tested in vitro for their anti-platelet property, tomato had the highest activity followed by grapefruit, melon, and strawberry, whereas pear and apple had little or no activity. Tomato extract (20-50 microl of 100% juice) inhibited both ADP- and collagen-induced aggregation by up to 70% but could not inhibit arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation and concomitant thromboxane synthesis under similar experimental conditions. The anti-platelet components (MW <1000 Da) in tomatoes are water soluble, heat stable and are concentrated in the yellow fluid around the seeds. The active fractions were separated using gel filtration and HPLC. The aqueous fraction (110 000 xg supernatant) of tomatoes containing anti-platelet activity was subjected to gel filtration column chromatography (Biogel P2 column). The activity was fractionated into two peaks, peak-3 and peak-4 (major peak). Subsequently, peak-4 was further purified by HPLC using a reversed-phase column. NMR and mass spectroscopy studies indicated that peak F2 (obtained from peak 4) contained adenosine and cytidine. Deamination of peak F2 with adenosine deaminase almost completely abolished its anti-platelet activity, confirming the presence of adenosine in this fraction. In comparison, deamination of peak-4 resulted in only partial loss of inhibitory activity while the activity of peak-3 remained unaffected. These results indicate that tomatoes contain anti-platelet compounds in addition to adenosine. Unlike aspirin, the tomato-derived compounds inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. All these data indicate that tomato contains very potent anti-platelet components, and consuming tomatoes might be beneficial both as a preventive and therapeutic regime for cardiovascular disease.",Platelets,"['D002478', 'D002851', 'D006801', 'D018551', 'D009682', 'D010936', 'D010974', 'D010975']","['Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Lycopersicon esculentum', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Plant Extracts', 'Platelet Aggregation', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors']",Effects of tomato extract on human platelet aggregation in vitro.,"[None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000494', 'Q000187', 'Q000494']","[None, None, None, None, None, 'pharmacology', 'drug effects', 'pharmacology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11454256,2001,0,0,tomato,apple,0.14772727272727273,"['grapefruit', 'strawberry', 'Deamination', 'adenosine', 'tomatoes', 'cytidine', 'microl', 'arachidonic', 'thromboxane', 'aspirin']",1,13

We describe the suitability of high-performance anion-exchange chromatography coupled with pulsed amperometric detection for the identification and quantification of fructans in fresh fruits (various apple and pear cultivars, plum, banana) as well as in commercial stewed fruits obtained from a local manufacturer. After extraction with water and appropriate filtration, inulobiose [beta-D-Fru-(2-->1)-beta-D-fructofuranoside; F2], 1-kestose [beta-D-Fru-(2-->1)2-alpha-D-glucopyranoside; GF2] and nystose [beta-D-Fru-(2-->1)3-alpha-D-glucopyranoside; GF3] were completely separated in a single 36-min run using a Dionex CarboPac PA 100 column and the new quadruple-potential waveform, originally tailored for oligosaccharide separation. No measurable amounts of F3 and GF4 were detected within the group of studied fruit products. Peak identification was realized using standards. The method is easy, reproducible, and sensitive since as little as 28 microg of sugar per gram dry matter can be quantified. Banana and plum are the varieties containing the highest levels of fructans (about 6000 microg per gram dry matter). The maturity of the fruit appears to have a great influence on the level of GF2. Samples of apple-banana stewed fruits contained the highest total fructan concentration (about 700 microg per gram dry matter).

These measurements employed a dynamic flow-through Teflon chamber, sample collection onto cartridges filled with graphitized carbon and thermal desorption gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for identification and quantification of the emitted volatiles. At full bloom the release of monoterpene hydrocarbons from cherry flowers was 1213 ng g(-1) dry weight (DW) h(-1), exceeding by approximately three-fold the emission rate of apple flowers (366 ng g(-1) DW h(-1)). Observed seasonal variations in biogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions ranged over several order of magnitudes. At fruit-set and ripening stages, in fact, the hydrocarbon emission dramatically decreased reaching the lowest values at harvest time when leaves were fully mature (3-9 ng g(-1) DW h(-1)). Wide diversity in the composition of compounds from the species studied was also recorded. At blooming, linalool contributed significantly to the monoterpene emission from apple (94% of the emitted carbon) while alpha-pinene and camphene represented on average more than 60% of the total emitted volatiles from cherry flowers. Among the monoterpenes identified in flowers, alpha-pinene, camphene and limonene were also found in the foliage emission of both species. Fruit trees are relevant monoterpene emitters only at blooming and thus for a short period of the vegetative cycle.

In this study, individual phenolics were measured by diode-array HPLC at monthly intervals in the peel of Granny Smith, Lady Williams, and Crofton apple cultivars stored in air at 0 degrees C for 9 months. The concentrations of total phenolics significantly differed among the cultivars examined, with Lady Williams peel having significantly more phenolics (over 4000 microg x g(-1) peel fresh weight) than Crofton (2668 microg x g(-1) peel fresh weight) and Granny Smith, which had the lowest concentration of total phenolics (1275 microg x g(-1) peel fresh weight). There were also significant differences in individual phenolics among cultivars and during storage.

The procedure involves determining the Brix value of the apple juice or apple juice concentrate and preparing a dilution of the test sample to 5.5 degrees Brix. A 100 microL aliquot of the 5.5 degrees Brix test solution is then freeze-dried in a GC autosampler vial. The sugars in the freeze-dried residue are converted to trimethylsilyl derivatives, by the addition of an appropriate silylation reagent, and the vial is heated at 75 degrees C for 30 min. After derivatization, the solution is introduced into a gas chromatograph where the analytes are separated on a 30 m, 0.25 m id DB-5 column. The method can use hydrogen, helium, or nitrogen as the carrier gas. The analytes and marker compounds are measured by use of a flame ionization detecone of the 2 syrups at 2 levels. Dilution was ascertained by the presence of retrograde sugar markers found in the 2 sugar syrups.

11312874,"A biocatalyst was prepared by immobilization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AXAZ-1 on apple pieces. It was examined by electron microscope and studied during the fermentation of grape must for batch wine-making. The immobilized yeast showed an important operational stability without any decrease of its activity even at low temperatures (1-12 degrees C). Specifically, at 6 degrees C the biocatalyst favored wine production within 8 days, which is less time than is required for the natural fermentation of grape must. At 1 degrees C wine production was effected in 1 month. This speeding up of the fermentation could be accepted and adopted by the industry for scaling up the wine-making process. Total and volatile acidities were similar to those found in dry wines. The concentrations of higher alcohols (propanol-1 and isobutyl alcohol) were low. The presence of amyl alcohols proved to be temperature dependent and decreased with the temperature decrease. The values of ethyl acetate concentrations were relatively high, up to 154 mg/L. This probably contributes to the fruity aroma and excellent taste of the produced wines. There was no indication of vinegar odor in the product given that the volatile acidity was <0.47 g of acetic acid/L.

Fatty acids are present in the free or esterified form and contribute to both the flavor and foam properties of cider. Fatty acids were separated and identified as methyl esters by GC-MS, and 12 of these were subsequently determined by GC-FID. The major fatty acids found in cider were caproic, caprylic, capric, and palmitic acid, the saturated acids predominating over the unsaturated ones. The proposed method was applied to 59 ciders from three consecutive harvests (1996, 1997, and 1998), which were made by 19 cider-makers from the region of Asturias (Spain). Linear discriminant analysis of fatty acids in these samples allowed selection of palmitoleic, pentadecanoic, linoleic, myristic, and linolenic acid as the most predictive variables to differentiate ciders made from apples grown in the Asturias region (1997 harvest) and ciders made from apples grown outside this region (1996 and 1998 harvests).",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,"['D001628', 'D002849', 'D005227', 'D005230', 'D005638', 'D008401']","['Beverages', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry']",Gas chromatographic analysis of total fatty acids in cider.,"['Q000032', 'Q000379', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000737', 'Q000379']","['analysis', 'methods', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'chemistry', 'methods']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11312846,2001,0,1,fatty acids in apple cider,apple,0.3269230769230769,"['palmitic acid', 'capric', 'caprylic', 'fatty acids', 'caproic', 'palmitoleic', 'methyl esters', 'myristic', 'Fatty acids', 'saturated acids', 'esterified', 'pentadecanoic', 'linolenic acid', 'linoleic']",1,17

11234803,"A competitive, indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for thiabendazole has been developed and applied to the analysis of fruit juices spiked with this fungicide. The immunoassay is based on a new monoclonal antibody derived from a hapten functionalized at the nitrogen atom in the 1-position of the thiabendazole structure. To our knowledge, such a structure has not been previously used to obtain antibodies to thiabendazole. The I50 value and the detection limit of the ELISA for standards were 0.2 and 0.05 ng/mL, respectively. Fruit juices were analyzed by diluting samples in assay buffer, without extraction or cleanup. Samples were not even centrifuged or filtered to remove fruit pulp. Under these conditions, the immunoassay was able to accurately determine thiabendazole down to 1 ng/mL in orange and grapefruit juices, down to 5 ng/mL in banana juice, and down to 20 ng/mL in apple and pear juices. Sensitivity differences of the ELISA were caused by the minimum dilution required by each juice to minimize matrix effects: 1/10 for orange and grapefruit juices, 1/50 for banana juice, and 1/100 for apple and pear juices. In an attempt to further increase the sensitivity of the immunoassay for matrixes showing the strongest interferences, apple and pear juices spiked with thiabendazole at low levels (1-20 ng/mL) were extracted with ethyl acetate before analysis. This simple procedure entailed a significant reduction of matrix effects, which in fact allowed us to determine accurately as low as 5 ng/mL thiabendazole in apple and pear juices.

30832070,"Flat apple disease-associated virus (FAV) was mechanically transmitted to the propagation host Chenopodium quinoa and double-stranded (ds)RNA recovered using CFII chromatography. Purified dsRNA was used to generate cDNA clones which were sequenced and the information used to design oligonucleotide primers for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and tube capture (TC)/RT-PCR analyses. Oligonucleotide primers for RT-PCR analysis and dot blot hybridization using digoxigenin-labeled cDNA clones were used for the detection of FAV and Cherry rasp leaf virus (CRLV) in C. quinoa, in leaf and bud wood tissue of apple, or both. Primers JQ3D33FF/FR amplified a virus-specific 429-bp fragment and reliably detected all isolates of FAV and CRLV tested by RT-PCR and TC/RT-PCR. Primers JQ2C1FF/FR amplified a 370-bp fragment and detected FAV and some isolates of CRLV. Comparison of amino acid residues derived from the 429-bp fragments of FAV and CRLV gave 95% identity. The RT-PCR assays provided strong evidence of a relationship between FAV and CRLV. These assays were also used to confirm virus elimination in apple plants after heat therapy. Western blot analysis of FAV revealed capsid protein subunits of approximately 22 and 24 kDa. Our data support biological and serological evidence that FAV and CRLV are isolates of the same virus. Searches of the database produced sequence matches only with RNA2 of Apple latent spherical virus (ALSV), a new member of the family Comoviridae.

11128219,"An HPLC-MS-MS method with selected reaction monitoring (SRM) for the determination of patulin in apple juice samples is described. Mass spectrometric detection was accomplished following atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in both positive and negative ion modes. Collision induced dissociation (CID) of the protonated molecular ion led initially to the loss of H2O (fragment m/z 137). At higher energies CO is lost from both the protonated parent molecule (fragment m/z 127) and the dehydrated molecular ion (fragment m/z 109). In contrast, CID of the deprotonated molecular ion led initially to the fragment at m/z 109 corresponding to the loss of either CO2 or acetaldehyde, followed at higher CID energy by the loss of H2O (fragment m/z 135) and CO (fragment m/z 125) from the deprotonated molecular ion. Detection in the negative ion mode proved superior and a linear response was observed over the injected range from 6 to 200 ng patulin. Apple juice samples spiked with patulin between 10 and 135 microg/l were analyzed following liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate and clean up with sodium carbonate. Utilizing reversed-phase HPLC with acetonitrile-water (10:90) at 0.5 ml/min, levels down to 10 microg/l were readily quantified and a detection limit of 4 microg/l was attainable at a signal-to-noise (SIN) ratio of 4.

11093668,"Liquid chromatography coupled to ion spray tandem mass spectrometry was developed as a method for the simultaneous analysis of the amino acid 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and its structural analogue, cyclopropane-1,1-dicarboxylic acid (CDA). ACC and CDA fragmentation as well as optimization of MS parameters were investigated in positive ion mode. In selective reaction monitoring mode the protonated molecule [M+H]+ was selected as parent ion for both ACC and CDA, while the immonium ion from ACC and the [M+H-H2O]+ ion from CDA were selected, respectively, as product ions. In spite of the high selectivity of MS/MS among the 20 protein amino acids potentially present with ACC and CDA in the plant material analyzed, Glu and Thr can interfere with the signal of ACC. As a result, their chromatographic separation is necessary. This was achieved in less than 4 min by ion-pair reversed-phase chromatography with nonafluoropentanoic acid as ion-pair reagent. A linear response within a concentration range of 1-5 mg l(-1) was observed for this LC method and the detection limit was found to be 20 pmol for ACC and 150 pmol for CDA (using a 20-microl loop).

Recombinant 6-histidine-tagged A4 domain proteins were prepared utilizing a bacterial expression system. Purification was accomplished under denaturing conditions, followed by a refolding protocol to facilitate correct disulfide bond formation. Analysis of the A4 domain (C321S mutant) by size exclusion chromatography indicated the presence of a slowly equilibrating reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium. The elution profiles reveal highly symmetrical peaks for both dimeric and monomeric species with elution times that were highly reproducible for varying amounts of both the dimeric and monomeric species. The monomer-dimer equilibrium was found to be dependent upon changes in both pH and salt concentration. Under conditions approximating physiologic salt concentration and pH (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), it was determined that the monomer-dimer equilibrium was characterized by a dissociation constant (K(D)) value of 229 +/- 26 nm with a calculated Delta G value of 9.1 kcal/mol. This report identifies electrostatic contributions and the presence of a hydrophobic component that mediate interactions at the A4 domain interface.

11087542,"trans-Cinnamaldehyde, the principal component of cinnamon flavor, is a potent antimicrobial compound present in essential oils such as cinnamon. In the course of studies designed to discover its maximum microbial lethality under food-processing conditions, a gas chromatographic-mass spectrophotometric procedure was developed for the extraction and analysis of essential oil components such as cinnamaldehyde from commercial cinnamon-containing foods (several brands of cinnamon breads, cereals, cookies, puddings, applesauces, and fruit juices). The cinnamaldehyde content ranged from trace amounts in orange juice to 12.2 mg/100 g (122 ppm) in apple cinnamon cereals and 31.1 mg/100 g (311 ppm) for cinnamon swirl bread (highest value). To ascertain the heat stability of cinnamaldehyde, pure cinnamaldehyde, pure eugenol, cinnamon oil, and mixtures consisting of cinnamaldehyde plus eugenol or cinnamon oil were heated at graded temperatures up to 210 degrees C and 60 min, and then possible compositional changes were examined. Eugenol was stable to heat, as were the components of cinnamon oil: carvone, eugenol, and linalool. In contrast, starting at approximately 60 degrees C, pure cinnamaldehyde undergoes a temperature-dependent transformation to benzaldehyde under the influence of heat. Eugenol, both pure and in cinnamon oil, when added to pure cinnamaldehyde protected the aldehyde against heat destruction. The protection may due to an antioxidative action of eugenol.

11087482,"An HPLC method, using detection after postcolumn derivatization with p-dimethylaminocynnamaldehyde (DMACA), was developed for the quantitative analysis of individual flavanols in food. This method was applied to flavanol determination in 56 different kinds of Spanish food products, including fruit, vegetables, legumes, beverages (cider, coffee, beer, tea, and wine), and chocolate. The determined compounds corresponded to the catechins and proanthocyanidin dimers and trimers usually present in food and, therefore, they were representative of the flavanols of low degree of polymerization consumed with the diet. The data generated could be used for calculation of the dietary intake of either individual or total flavanols, which would allow the further establishment of epidemiological correlations with the incidence of chronic diseases. Similar flavanol profiles were found in the different samples of a similar type of product, even though important variations could exist in the concentrations of total and individual flavanols among them. This was attributed to factors such as sample origin, stage of ripeness, post-harvesting conservation, and processing. Total flavanol contents varied from nondetectable in most of the vegetables to 184 mg/100 g found in a sample of broad bean. Substantial amounts were also found in some fruits, such as plum and apple, as well as in tea and red wine. Epicatechin was the most abundant flavanol, followed by catechin and procyanidin B2. In general, catechins were found in all the flavanol-containing products, but the presence of gallocatechins was only relevant in pomegranate, broad bean, lentil, grape, wine, beer, and tea, and most of the berries.

Detection of low populations of A. acidoterrestris that would precede sensory detection of guaiacol would enable juice processors to select appropriate processing and storage conditions that would minimize or eliminate spoilage. The objective of this study was to determine the recognition threshold of guaiacol in apple juice by sensory analysis and the population of A. acidoterrestris and incubation time at 21 and 37 degrees C necessary for chemical detection of guaiacol.

As controls, apple 2-beta(2)GPI and apple 4-C321S-beta(2)GPI-W316S, in which beta(2)GPI-W316S is not able to bind to phospholipids, were made. In a phospholipid binding assay, apple 4-beta(2)GPI and apple 4-C321S-beta(2)GPI were able to bind to phospholipids with an affinity 35 times higher than that of plasma-derived beta(2)GPI and apple 2-beta(2)GPI. Apple 4-C321S-beta(2)GPI-W316S did not bind at all. Only apple 4-beta(2)GPI and apple 4-C321S-beta(2)GPI were able to bind to adhered platelets as shown by immunofluorescence.

Despite the high neutral sugar content, these rhamnogalacturonans strongly bound to a DEAE column. The third population which originated from the ramified 'hairy' regions was a neutral population, which did not interact with the DEAE column and had a low apparent molecular weight and a high Ara and ferulic acid content.

10942080,"Fruit of two apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) cultivars, differing in their ability to produce anthocyanin pigments when exposed to sunlight, have been studied using reflectance spectroscopy. Comparison of the spectra shows that apple anthocyanins in vivo possess a symmetric absorption band at 500-600 nm with a maximum near 550 nm. Anthocyanins considerably increase light absorption by apples. In on-tree-ripening Zhigulevskoe apples, accumulating high amounts of anthocyanin pigments, chlorophyll contents in sunlit and shaded sides of the fruits are found to be similar. In contrast, frequently considerably lower chlorophyll content is estimated in sunlit compared with shaded sides of Antonovka apples exhibiting low potential for anthocyanin formation. Sunlight also brings about an increase of carotenoid content over that of chlorophylls and accumulation of substances responsible for light absorption in the range 350-400 nm. The rates of high-light-induced chlorophyll bleaching in red zones of fruit containing anthocyanins are considerably lower than those in green zones and decrease with an increase in the pigment content. Anthocyanins show more stability to irradiation than chlorophylls. A protective function of anthocyanins against both light-induced stress in, and damage to, apples is suggested. It is proposed that anthocyanins function as an effective internal light trap filling the chlorophyll absorption gap in the green-orange part of the visible spectrum.","Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

The analytical DSI method entailed the following steps: (1) blend 30 g sample with 60 mL acetonitrile for 1 min in a centrifuge bottle; (2) add 6 g NaCl and blend 30 s; (3) centrifuge for 1-2 min; (4) add 5 mL upper layer to 1 g anhydrous MgSO4 in a vial; and (5) analyze 11 microL extract, using DSI/GC/MS-MS.

Twenty-five amino acids, eluting in 31 separate, characteristic derivatives, were determined on all six columns (the main component, asparagine, present in overwhelming excess, together with the minor constituents glutamine, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, homoserine, and homoarginine). Optimum conditions in the case of both derivatives were obtained on the same type of column (Hypersil, 5 microm), as follows: for the OPA/MPA amino acids with programmed flow-rate [1.3-2.3 ml/min; column, 200(+20 guard)x4 mm], at 50 degrees C, while, for the OPA/NAC amino acids at 2.1 ml/min flow rate, at 30 degrees C [column, 150(+20 guard)x4 mm], with 40 and 37 min run times, including equilibration. Responses of the corresponding amino acids proved to be independent of the column used; reproducibility in the concentration range 6-12,000 pmol, related to the injected amount of amino acids, was <3.4% RSD (average relative standard deviation percentage). The utility of the protocol was demonstrated in the quantitation of the free amino acid content of five apple varieties (Jonagored, Idared, Jonica, Florina, Freedom) on various harvesting dates and after different storage times.

10685100,"Pheromone titer in moths is a product of three processes occurring in or at the surface of the pheromone gland: biosynthesis, release, and intraglandular degradation, of pheromone. Changes in titers of sex pheromone, the fatty acyl pheromone analog (FAPA), and tetradecanoate, a pheromone biosynthetic intermediate, were studied in detail in the lightbrown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker). Although changes in the pheromone titers in a day were relatively small, with the peak titer being 2-3 times greater than that at the trough, pheromone titer did show a distinct diel periodicity. Titer of the FAPA showed a similar, but less variable, diel pattern, but tetradecanoate titer showed little or no diel pattern. The pattern of pheromone titer suggested that females biosynthesize pheromone at two different rates during the photoperiod: a high rate during the latter half of the photophase and most of the scotophase, which is associated with a high pheromone titer, and a low rate throughout the first half of the photophase, which is associated with a low titer. Consistent with data on commencement of copulation, pheromone was released from the second hour of the scotophase through to the eighth hour. Pheromone release rate during this period appeared to be similar to the rate of pheromone biosynthesis. In contrast to the other two processes, pheromone degradation did not appear to have a diel pattern. Females decapitated at different times of the photoperiod showed a similar decline in pheromone titer, consistent with the reaction kinetics being first order in pheromone titer.",Archives of insect biochemistry and physiology,"['D000818', 'D002849', 'D002940', 'D005227', 'D005229', 'D005260', 'D009036', 'D010675']","['Animals', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated', 'Female', 'Moths', 'Pheromones']","Periodicity of sex pheromone biosynthesis, release and degradation in the lightbrown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker).","[None, 'Q000662', 'Q000502', 'Q000032', 'Q000378', None, 'Q000502', 'Q000096']","[None, 'veterinary', 'physiology', 'analysis', 'metabolism', None, 'physiology', 'biosynthesis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10685100,2000,0,0,Apple moth,apple,0.15384615384615385,"['tetradecanoate', 'Pheromone', 'fatty acyl pheromone', 'pheromone']",1,12

The [(14)C]celecoxib was administered as a fine suspension reconstituted in 80 ml of an apple juice/Tween 80/ethanol mixture. Blood and saliva samples were collected at selected time intervals after dosing. All urine and feces were collected on the 10 consecutive days after dose administration. Radioactivity in each sample was determined by liquid scintillation counting or complete oxidation and liquid scintillation counting. Metabolic profiles in plasma, urine, and feces were obtained by HPLC, and metabolites were identified by mass spectrometry and NMR. [(14)C]Celecoxib was well absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 2 h of dosing. [(14)C]Celecoxib was extensively metabolized, with only 2.56% of the radioactive dose excreted as celecoxib in either urine or feces. The total percentage of administered radioactive dose recovered was 84.8 +/- 4.9%, with 27.1 +/- 2.2% in the urine and 57.6 +/- 7.3% in the feces. The oxidative metabolism of celecoxib involved hydroxylation of celecoxib at the methyl moiety followed by further oxidation of the hydroxyl group to form a carboxylic acid metabolite. The carboxylic acid metabolite of celecoxib was conjugated with glucuronide to form the 1-O-glucuronide. The percentages of the dose excreted in the feces as celecoxib and the carboxylic acid metabolite were 2.56 +/- 1.09 and 54.4 +/- 6.8%, respectively.

10653746,"The distinctive flavor of wine, brandy, and other grape-derived alcoholic beverages is affected by many compounds, including esters produced during alcoholic fermentation. The characteristic fruity odors of the fermentation bouquet are primarily due to a mixture of hexyl acetate, ethyl caproate (apple-like aroma), iso-amyl acetate (banana-like aroma), ethyl caprylate (apple-like aroma), and 2-phenylethyl acetate (fruity, flowery flavor with a honey note). The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of improving the aroma of wine and distillates by overexpressing one of the endogenous yeast genes that controls acetate ester production during fermentation. The synthesis of acetate esters by the wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae during fermentation is ascribed to at least three acetyltransferase activities, namely, alcohol acetyltransferase (AAT), ethanol acetyltransferase, and iso-amyl AAT. To investigate the effect of increased AAT activity on the sensory quality of Chenin blanc wines and distillates from Colombar base wines, we have overexpressed the alcohol acetyltransferase gene (ATF1) of S. cerevisiae. The ATF1 gene, located on chromosome XV, was cloned from a widely used commercial wine yeast strain of S. cerevisiae, VIN13, and placed under the control of the constitutive yeast phosphoglycerate kinase gene (PGK1) promoter and terminator. Chromoblot analysis confirmed the integration of the modified copy of ATF1 into the genome of three commercial wine yeast strains (VIN7, VIN13, and WE228). Northern blot analysis indicated constitutive expression of ATF1 at high levels in these yeast transformants. The levels of ethyl acetate, iso-amyl acetate, and 2-phenylethyl acetate increased 3- to 10-fold, 3.8- to 12-fold, and 2- to 10-fold, respectively, depending on the fermentation temperature, cultivar, and yeast strain used. The concentrations of ethyl caprate, ethyl caprylate, and hexyl acetate only showed minor changes, whereas the acetic acid concentration decreased by more than half. These changes in the wine and distillate composition had a pronounced effect on the solvent or chemical aroma (associated with ethyl acetate and iso-amyl acetate) and the herbaceous and heads-associated aromas of the final distillate and the solvent or chemical and fruity or flowery characters of the Chenin blanc wines. This study establishes the concept that the overexpression of acetyltransferase genes such as ATF1 could profoundly affect the flavor profiles of wines and distillates deficient in aroma, thereby paving the way for the production of products maintaining a fruitier character for longer periods after bottling.",Applied and environmental microbiology,"['D000085', 'D000123', 'D015152', 'D002849', 'D003001', 'D005285', 'D011506', 'D011994', 'D012441', 'D013649', 'D014920']","['Acetates', 'Acetyltransferases', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Fermentation', 'Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Taste', 'Wine']",Effect of increased yeast alcohol acetyltransferase activity on flavor profiles of wine and distillates.,"['Q000378', 'Q000235', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000378', 'Q000201', None, 'Q000382']","['metabolism', 'genetics', None, None, None, None, None, 'metabolism', 'enzymology', None, 'microbiology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10653746,2000,0,0,Apple-like,apple,0.18309859154929578,"['acetate esters', 'ethyl caproate', 'acetate ester', 'acetic acid', 'ethyl acetate', 'iso-amyl acetate', 'Chenin blanc wines', 'alcohol', 'apple-like aroma', 'ethanol', 'final distillate', 'esters', 'distillate', 'banana-like aroma), ethyl caprylate', 'hexyl acetate', 'ethyl caprate', 'ethyl caprylate', '2-phenylethyl acetate']",1,26
10630991,"To localize the platelet binding site on factor XI, rationally designed, conformationally constrained synthetic peptides were used to compete with [(125)I]factor XI binding to activated platelets. The major platelet binding energy resided within the sequence of amino acids T(249)-F(260). Homology scanning, using prekallikrein amino acid substitutions within the synthetic peptide T(249)-F(260), identified a major role for R(250) in platelet binding. Inhibition of [(125)I]factor XI binding to activated platelets by the recombinant Apple 3 domain of factor XI and inhibition by unlabeled factor XI were identical, whereas the recombinant Apple 3 domain of prekallikrein had little effect. A ""gain-of-function"" chimera in which the C-terminal amino acid sequence of the Apple 3 domain of prekallikrein was replaced with that of factor XI was as effective as the recombinant Apple 3 domain of factor XI and unlabeled factor XI in inhibiting [(125)I]factor XI binding to activated platelets.

Thus, the binding energy mediating the interaction of factor XI with platelets is contained within the C-terminal amino acid sequence of the Apple 3 domain (T(249)-V(271)) and is mediated in part by amino acid residues R(250), K(255), F(260), and Q(263).",Biochemistry,"['D000595', 'D001665', 'D001792', 'D002851', 'D005172', 'D006801', 'D007457', 'D008958', 'D008969', 'D015539', 'D016133', 'D011288']","['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Platelets', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Factor XI', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Platelet Activation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prekallikrein']","Factor XI binding to activated platelets is mediated by residues R(250), K(255), F(260), and Q(263) within the apple 3 domain.","[None, None, 'Q000378', None, 'Q000737', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000737']","[None, None, 'metabolism', None, 'chemistry', None, None, None, None, None, None, 'chemistry']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10630991,2000,0,0,apple genetics,apple,0.109375,"['Alanine', 'amino acid', 'amino acids']",1,7

Two K. lactis recombinants exhibiting xylogalacturonan-hydrolyzing activity were found among the 3,400 colonies tested. The cDNA insert of these recombinants encoded a 406-amino-acid protein, designated XghA, which was encoded by a single-copy gene, xghA. A multiple-sequence alignment revealed that XghA was similar to both polygalacturonases (PGs) and rhamnogalacturonases. A detailed examination of conserved regions in the sequences of these enzymes revealed that XghA resembled PGs more. High-performance liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry of the products of degradation of xylogalacturonan and saponified modified hairy regions of apple pectin by XghA demonstrated that this enzyme uses an endo type of mechanism.

10552550,"A procedure combining diphasic dialysis extraction with in situ acylation and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) determination was developed for detection and quantification of the mycotoxin patulin in apple juice. Apple juice samples spiked with 4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine were dialyzed using methane chloride and acetic anhydride inside dialysis tubing. Patulin was derivatized into its acetate and collected in the tubing after diphasic dialysis and was directly determined using GC/MS with the selective ion monitoring mode without further concentration and cleanup steps. Quantification was carried out by a calibration curve with an internal standard of correlation. The appropriate parameters of both dialysis and derivatization were examined. The linear range of the calibration curve was found to be 10-250 microg/L for patulin, and the limit of quantification was 10 microg/L. Levels of patulin ranging from 0 to 107.2 microg/L with 77-109% recovery were found in 10 apple samples.

10552540,"The ripening of Jonagored Jonagold apple fruit (Malus x domestica Borkh.) during development was manipulated with preharvest applications of ReTain or a combination of ReTain plus Ethrel. The fruits, harvested preclimacteric at approximately the same stages of maturity, were stored in refrigerated air (RA) for 45 days or in controlled atmosphere (CA) for 180 days at 0 degrees C. Volatile evolution, ethylene production, and respiration of stored fruit were studied during poststorage holding at 22 degrees C. ReTain reduced volatile production by 19%, but application of Ethrel to ReTain-treated fruit increased production to control levels. The inhibition of volatile production by ReTain appears to be independent of respiration but may be related to the ethylene-producing capacity of the fruit. Although ReTain reduced flavor-related volatile esters, it did not affect levels of the compound responsible for the typical spicy flavor in Jonagored Jonagold fruit, 4-methoxy-2-propenylbenzene. The CA-stored fruit had a much reduced production of volatile compounds compared to RA-stored fruit, with more discernible effects in ReTain-treated fruit. Ethrel application to ReTain-treated fruit improved the volatile production intermediate between the ReTain alone and control in CA-stored fruit. The data collectively suggest that ReTain may have some promise for better scheduling of harvest of apples with no appreciable loss in RA-stored fruit quality.

10353589,"Dietary phenolic compounds, ubiquitous in vegetables and fruits and their juices possess antioxidant activity that may have beneficial effects on human health. The phenolic composition of six commercial apple juices, and of the peel (RP), flesh (RF) and whole fresh Red Delicious apples (RW), was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and total phenols were determined by the Folin-Ciocalteau method. HPLC analysis identified and quantified several classes of phenolic compounds: cinnamates, anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols and flavonols. Phloridzin and hydroxy methyl furfural were also identified. The profile of phenolic compounds varied among the juices. The range of concentrations as a percentage of total phenolic concentration was: hydroxy methyl furfural, 4-30%; phloridzin, 22-36%; cinnamates, 25-36%; anthocyanins, n.d.; flavan-3-ols, 8-27%; flavonols, 2-10%. The phenolic profile of the Red Delicious apple extracts differed from those of the juices. The range of concentrations of phenolic classes in fresh apple extracts was: hydroxy methyl furfural, n.d.; phloridzin, 11-17%; cinnamates, 3-27%; anthocyanins, n.d.-42%; flavan-3-ols, 31-54%; flavonols, 1-10%. The ability of compounds in apple juices and extracts from fresh apple to protect LDL was assessed using an in vitro copper catalyzed human LDL oxidation system. The extent of LDL oxidation was determined as hexanal production using static headspace gas chromatography. The apple juices and extracts, tested at 5 microM gallic acid equivalents (GAE), all inhibited LDL oxidation. The inhibition by the juices ranged from 9 to 34%, and inhibition by RF, RW and RP was 21, 34 and 38%, respectively. Regression analyses revealed no significant correlation between antioxidant activity and either total phenolic concentration or any specific class of phenolics.

9813019,"The glycosaminoglycan heparin enhances several reactions involving coagulation factor XI (FXI) including activation of FXI by factor XIIa, thrombin, and autoactivation; and inactivation of activated FXI (FXIa) by serine protease inhibitors. We examined the effect of heparin on inhibition of FXIa by the inhibitors C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) and antithrombin III (ATIII). Second order rate constants for inhibition in the absence of heparin were 1.57 x 10(3) and 0.91 x 10(3) M-1 s-1 for C1-INH and ATIII, respectively. Therapeutic heparin concentrations (0.1-1.0 units/ml) enhanced inhibition by ATIII 20-55-fold compared with 0.1-7.0-fold for C1-INH. For both inhibitors, the effect of heparin over a wide range of concentrations (10(-1) to 10(5) units/ml) produced bell-shaped curves, demonstrating that inhibition occurs by a template mechanism requiring both inhibitor and protease to bind to heparin. This implies that FXI/XIa contains structural elements that interact with heparin. Human FXI contains a sequence of amino acids (R250-I-K-K-S-K) in the apple 3 domain of the heavy chain that binds heparin (Ho, D., Badellino, K., Baglia, F., and Walsh, P. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 16382-16390). To determine the importance of this sequence to heparin-mediated reactions, recombinant FXI molecules with alanine substitutions for basic amino acids were expressed in 293 fibroblasts, and tested in heparin-dependent assays. Inhibition of FXIa by ATIII in the presence of heparin was decreased 4-fold by alanine substitution at Lys253 (A253), with smaller effects noted for mutants A255 and A252. FXI undergoes autoactivation to FXIa in the presence of heparin. The rate of autoactivation was decreased substantially for A253 with modest decreases for A255 and A252. Substituting all four charged residues in the sequence resulted in a profound decrease in autoactivation, significantly greater than for any single substitution. Relative affinity for heparin was tested by determining the concentration of NaCl required to elute FXIa from heparin-Sepharose. Wild type FXIa eluted from the column at 320 mM NaCl, whereas FXIa with multiple substitutions (A252-254 or A250-255) eluted at 230 mM NaCl.

9808641,"In a 10-wk study with nonpregnant women (21-27 y, n = 5-6 per group), subjects were fed a diet containing approximately 68 nmol/d (30 microg/d) folate from food that was supplemented with folic acid in apple juice to yield a constant intake of 454, 680 or 907 nmol/d (200, 300 or 400 microg/d) to evaluate folate status and long-term in vivo kinetics. Reported here is an additional phase of this protocol conducted to determine the relationship between short-term urinary excretion after a single isotopically labeled dose and various measures of folate nutritional status. It was hypothesized that urinary excretion from a single [glutamate-2H4]folic acid ([2H4]folic acid) dose would increase in proportion to folate nutritional status due to saturable cellular uptake and retention processes along with saturation of renal reabsorption. Each subject was given 1.13 micromol (500 microg) of [2H4]folic acid orally on the morning of d 70 of the study, followed by a complete 24-h urine collection. Urine was analyzed to determine the isotopic enrichment of urinary folate by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and the concentration of urinary folate by HPLC. Urinary excretion of [2H4]folate was greatest at the 907 nmol/d intake and was positively correlated with serum folate concentration but was not correlated with erythrocyte folate. Excretion of [2H4]folate tended to be greatest when plasma homocysteine concentrations were low (<8 micromol/L), although this relation was not significant.

This ""direct analysis"" was compared to analysis of samples prepared by exhaustive ethanol extraction of the same ground plant tissues. Comparisons included leaf blades from apple, grape, corn, and tomato and leaf blade, petiole, stem, and pod tissues from soybean plants. Direct analysis gave superior quantification of sucrose, glucose, and fructose because of sucrose hydrolysis during ethanol extraction. Sucrose hydrolysis was highly variable among plant species and use of hot ethanol at the first extraction step reduced sucrose hydrolysis but did not always abolish it. Sucrose hydrolysis was probably due to the activity of hydrolytic enzymes in 75% ethanol at room temperature. Direct analysis was inferior for the quantification of cyclitols in the fibrous tissues of soybean but provided acceptable results for cyclitol analysis in leaf blade tissue. When the time for extraction/reaction was extended from 40 to 60 min, some improvement in recovery of cyclitols was observed, but recovery remained 10 to 20% below that obtained with exhaustive ethanol extraction. Mannitol was vacuum infiltrated into the five types of leaf tissue and recovery averaged 100% by the direct method relative to ETOH extraction for apple, grape, corn, and soybean leaves but was only 76% for tomato leaves.

9606152,"A continuous spectrophotometric method for determining the monophenolase activity of polyphenol oxidase from several plant sources is described. This assay method is based on the coupling reaction between 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone and the quinone product of the oxidation of 4-hydroxyanisole in the presence of polyphenol oxidase. 4-Hydroxyanisole proved to be the best monophenol assayed to measure the monophenolase activity of polyphenol oxidase from apple, artichoke, avocado, medlar, pear, and strawberry. Kinetic constants of 4-hydroxyanisole were compared to those of p-hydroxyphenyl propionic acid, a very sensitive monophenol previously reported to assay the monophenolase activity of polyphenol oxidase from apple, pear, and mushroom. The high values of the maximum steady state rate obtained for 4-hydroxyanisole suggest the existence of high catalytic constant toward this monophenol. These kinetic values were supported by nuclear magnetic resonance assays which predicted the highest reactivity of 4-hydroxyanisole. Therefore nuclear magnetic resonance assays proved to be a valuable and useful tool to predict the best monophenolic substrate for plant polyphenol oxidases. The 3-methyl-2-benzothiazlolinone-adduct for 4-hydroxyanisole was stable, with high molar absorptivity at the optimum pHs of the polyphenol oxidases assayed.

18945056,"ABSTRACT Cell suspension cultures of the scab-resistant apple (Malus x domestica) cultivar Liberty were challenged with yeast extract to mimic the effect of biological stress such as fungal invasion. The cells responded to the challenge by production of novel compounds. Suspension cultures of the scab-susceptible cultivar McIntosh, when similarly challenged, showed no detectable response. The major compound produced by scab-resistant cells in response to the challenge has been identified as the 2,4-methoxy-3-hydroxy-9-O-beta-D-glucosyloxydibenzofuran by UV, mass spectrometry, (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and (13)C-NMR spectroscopy. We suggest the trivial name malusfuran for the compound. Malusfuran production was initiated approximately 24 h after being challenged. Malusfuran inhibited spore germination and growth of Venturia inaequalis at millimolar concentrations, indicating its role as a possible phytoalexin. The aglycone of malusfuran, 2,4-methoxy-3,9-hydroxy-dibenzofuran, showed higher toxicity to V. inaequalis than to the parent malusfuran. In vitro cultures of V. inaequalis produced a beta-glucosidase that hydrolyzed ortho- and para-substituted nitrophenyl-beta-glucosides, suggesting that the aglycone may act as the actual phytoalexin.",Phytopathology,[],[],Phytoalexin Production in an Apple Cultivar Resistant to Venturia inaequalis.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18945056,2012,0,0,apple scab disease,apple,0.18518518518518517,"['phytoalexin', 'Malusfuran', '2,4-methoxy-3,9-hydroxy-dibenzofuran', 'millimolar', 'malusfuran', '2,4-methoxy-3-hydroxy-9-O-beta-D-glucosyloxydibenzofuran', 'aglycone']",1,10
15739455,"A liquid chromatographic method using semi-microcolumn separation combined with laser resonance Raman detection was developed for the determination of monosaccharides in fruit juices. Reducing sugars (galactose, glucose, mannose, arabinose, xylose and ribose) were derivatized with 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4'-sulfonyl (DABSYL) hydrazine. The derivatives of the monosaccharides exhibited strong resonance Raman scattering at 1136 cm(-1) when Ar+ laser emission line 488.0 nm was used. A semi-microcolumn Inertsil ODS-2 (250 mm x 1.5 mm i.d.) was used to the separation of the monosaccharide derivatives. The saccharides eluted within 25 min. However the excess DABSYL hydrazine was retained strongly with a retention time of about 60 min. In order to reduce the longer analysis time, the excess DABSYL hydrazine was removed by adding glyoxylic acid and then Na2CO3 aqueous solution when the derivation reaction was finished. As a result, the analysis time was reduced to about a half of its initial run time. The sensitivity of resonance Raman detection greater two orders of magnitude than refractive index (RI) detection. The detection limit of glucose is 10 ng (5.5 pmol). The high selectivity of Raman detection came from the facts that only the interested compounds in a given sample was derived with the Raman labeling reagent and that only the characteristic Raman bands of the derivatives were selectively detected.

9129299,"Ethylenethiourea (ETU) is a decomposition product from ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamates (EBDCs), the most widely used class of fungicides in the world. ETU has been classified as a possible human carcinogen. The maximum permitted residue level (MRL) in the European Union was set at 0.05 ppm. Gas chromatographic determination of ETU can be achieved only after derivatization. ETU is extracted from food samples and cleaned up by a combination of two-step derivatization and liquid-liquid partitioning. In the first step, ETU is derivatized with benzyl chloride to form S-benzyl ETU, which is then trifluoroacetylated to form the final product, which is amenable to GC. The determination is carried out with capillary gas chromatography using electron-capture (ECD) and nitrogen-phosphorus detection (NPD) as selective detection methods in parallel. The responses of ECD and NPD were found to be of the same order of magnitude. Therefore, the parallel response was found to be a useful criterion for peak identification down to the limit of detection. Reproducibility of the two-step derivatization of ETU to form trifluoroacetylated S-benzyl ETU was found to be satisfactory. The recoveries from apple, pear, tomato and a common baby food, at various concentration levels, were found to be between 82-92%, with a limit of detection of less than 1 ppb. Commercial samples, submitted for routine monitoring of dithiocarbamates (DTC) were also monitored in our laboratory for the presence of ETU. Four of the twenty samples found positive for DTC were also found to be contaminated with ETU in the range of 0.01 to 0.37 ppm. Three of these food samples were found to contain ETU residues above the MRL of 0.05, while those food samples containing DTC residues between 0.2 and 0.8 ppm were all below the MRL of DTC. No relation exists between the DTC residues concentration and the level of ETU. The screening data were further confirmed by electron impact mass spectrometry in selected ion monitoring mode.

8946792,"Solid phase microextraction (SPME) was evaluated for use in the quantification of aroma volatile production by Granny Smith apples during cool storage. Particular attention was paid to quantifying alpha-farnesene (3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-1,3(E),6(E),10-tetraene) due to its involvement in superficial scald, a disorder of cool stored apples. Comparison between SPME and solid phase extraction (SPE) showed that the SPME fiber had greater adsorption of high molecular weight (MW) volatiles such as alpha-farnesene. When sampling by SPME, these higher MW volatiles did not equilibrate between apples, headspace, and fiber within sampling times as long as 90 min, while lower MW volatiles equilibrated within 5 min. This behavior was also shown by a simple model system consisting of five selected volatiles dissolved in an involatile, lipophilic liquid (squalane). The less volatile high MW aroma compounds evaporated slowly from the surface of the apples and were depleted from the headspace because of very rapid adsorption by the SPME fiber. The amount of alpha-farnesene adsorbed by the fiber increased with air movement through the system. In a static headspace system, the amount of alpha-farnesene adsorbed by the fiber decreased nonlinearly with increasing distance from the apples, due to adsorption onto the glass walls. While SPME is ideal for rapid, qualitative determination of apple headspace volatiles, the slower equilibration of higher MW volatiles limits its use for quantification in more complex systems.",Analytical chemistry,"['D002849', 'D005638', 'D008401', 'D012717', 'D014835']","['Chromatography, Gas', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Volatilization']",Solid phase microextraction for quantitative headspace sampling of apple volatiles.,"[None, 'Q000737', None, 'Q000032', None]","[None, 'chemistry', None, 'analysis', None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8946792,1997,0,1,volatiles,apple,0.14864864864864866,"['SPE', 'squalane', 'headspace', 'alpha-farnesene', 'alpha-farnesene (3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-1,3(E),6(E),10-tetraene', 'SPME']",1,11

White grape-juices (3) as well as other fruit juices (2 apple, 6 orange, 2 others) did not contain OA (< 5 pg/ml). The analytical method used was not appropriate for grapefruit-juices because of an interfering substance. The results indicate that OA is formed prior to the alcoholic fermentation. It also appears that the more southerly in Europe is the origin of the samples the higher is the frequency of occurrence and the concentration of OA in red wines and red grape-juices. Although the estimated mean daily OA intake of 0-7 ng/kg body mass (men) can easily be more than doubled by moderate wine consumption, an additional health risk by OA is not to be expected.

8704950,"DNA fragments with ams genes of Erwinia amylovora and cps genes of Erwinia stewartii were transferred to exopolysaccharide (EPS)-deficient mutants of the other species. The resulting EPSs were characterized by sensitivity to EPS-dependent bacteriophages, staining with amylovoran-specific fluorescein-isothiocyanate-labelled lectin and chemical techniques, such as determination of the sugar composition and methylation analysis in order to distinguish between amylovoran and stewartan. Degradation by the stewartan-dependent phage phi-K9 was used to detect stewartan production, and staining with a lectin from Abrus precatorius detected amylovoran capsules. The patterns of sugar linkages were determined by methylation analysis. Stewartan contained a significantly higher glucose to galactose ratio than amylovoran and produced a characteristic signal from 6-linked glucose residues. By these criteria, most E. stewartii cps mutants displayed exclusively amylovoran synthesis when complemented with the E. stewartii cps genes produced stewartan. The complementation to an EPS-positive phenotype may require most genes of the ams or the cps operon. An exception was an E. stewartii cpsK mutant that made predominantly stewartan when complemented with the ams cosmid. IR spectra showed that both amylovoran and stewartan were acylated when synthetized in E. amylovora, but not in E. stewartii.

For this reason, microwave digestion with HNO3 and cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry (CVAAS) with tin (II) chloride reduction, were used. Both digestion and determination conditions were experimentally optimized. The procedure was checked using two real food samples: apple juice and preserved carrot with peas both spiked on two levels with mercury. On these results basic statistic parameters that characterized the method as standard deviation, relative standard deviation and recovery, were calculated. The precision was generally better than 10%, and recovery ranged from 96 to 100%. The detection limit of the entire procedure, defined as the mercury concentration corresponding to three times the standard deviation of ten consecutive determinations of blank measurement, was 0.012 microgram/l. Taking into account the amount of a sample and the factor of dilution the detection limit corresponds to 0.3 microgram/kg for 1.0 g, 1.0 microgram/kg for 0.3 g, and 0.15 microgram/l for 2 ml of a sample. Accuracy of the analytical procedure was tested by analysing five certified reference plant materials with the mercury contents ranged from 6 to 280 micrograms/kg. The obtained results were in a good agreement with their certified values.

This study was designed to determine whether such children are exposed to higher levels of pesticides than children whose parents are not involved in agriculture and whose homes are not close to farms. Household dust and soil samples were collected in children's play areas from 59 residences in eastern Washington State (26 farming, 22 farmworker, and 11 nonfarming families). The majority of the farm families lived within 200 feet of an operating apple or pear orchard, whereas all reference homes were located at least a quarter of a mile from an orchard. Four organophosphorous (OP) insecticides commonly used on tree fruit were targeted for analysis: azinphosmethyl, chlorpyrifos, parathion, and phosmet. Samples were extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass selective detection. Pesticide concentrations in household dust were significantly higher than in soil for all groups. OP levels for farmer/farm-worker families ranged from nondetectable to 930 ng/g in soil (0.93 ppm) and from nondetectable to 17,000 ng/g in dust (17 ppm); all four OP compounds were found in 62% of household dust samples, and two-thirds of the farm homes contained at least one OP above 1000 ng/g. Residues were found less frequently in reference homes and all levels were below 1000 ng/g. Household dust concentrations for all four target compounds were significantly lower in reference homes when compared to farmer/farmworker homes (Mann Whitney, U test; p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that children of agricultural families have a higher potential for exposure to OP pesticides than children of nonfarm families in this region. Measurable residues of a toxicity, I compound registered exclusively for agricultural use, azcnphosmettyl were found in household dust samples from all study homes, suggesting that low level exposure to such chemicals occurs throughout the region.

8678307,"A continuous spectrophotometric method for the determination of the monophenolase and diphenolase activities of apple polyphenol oxidase is described. The method is based on the coupling reaction between 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone (MBTH) and the quinone product of the oxidation of p-hydroxyphenyl propionic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl propionic acid in the presence of polyphenol oxidase. The lambda(max) and molar absorptivity (epsilon) for the MBTH-quinone adduct have been calculated. The presence of MBTH in the reaction medium decreases the lag period during the expression of monophenolase activity. The high value of V(mas) suggests the existence of a high catalytic constant.

8529228,"Alcohol insoluble solids from apple were extracted in sequence by buffer at 20 degrees C and at 70 degrees C, EDTA/oxalate, and mild alkali, yielding four populations of pectins. These pectins and the insoluble residue were characterized by their sugar composition, degree of esterification (methyl ester and O-acetyl groups), molecular weight distribution, and degradability by the combination of endopolygalacturonase (PG) and pectin esterase (PE) and by rhamnogalacturonase (RGase) after chemical saponification. After PG/PE treatment, the remaining high molecular weight material representing the pectic hairy regions was isolated and characterized. Clear differences were found in the sugar composition of the fractions obtained, while only small variations were observed in the sugar linkage composition. The pectic hairy regions were further degraded by RGase and the digests separated into high molecular weight and oligomeric degradation products. These ""RGase oligomers"" consisted of between 4 and 9 sugar units with a backbone of alternating rhamnose and galacturonic acid residues, partly substituted with galactose linked to C-4 of the rhamnose moiety. Both the absolute amount of RGase oligosaccharides released as well as the degree of galactose-substitution of the oligomers increased when severer extraction conditions were used. Relatively more RGase oligomers were released from the low molecular weight hairy regions as compared to the high molecular weight fraction.

In the case of apples, highly active, low-temperature extracts were used. The purity of the allergens was checked by analytic SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with allergic patients' sera, as well as by N-terminal amino acid microsequencing, and the allergens were found to be very pure. The strong immunologic activity of the isolates was determined by the enzyme allergosorbent test (EAST) and EAST inhibition assays; this activity was, in the case of Bet v I, similar to that of a preparation obtained by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography. The allergenic potency of Bet v I and of the cross-reactive apple allergen was determined by EAST inhibition and dose-related histamine release. With both assay systems, the allergenic reactivity of Bet v I was considerably higher than that of the major apple allergen. Furthermore, skin prick tests with the purified allergens and with whole allergenic extracts were performed on a group of 33 patients suffering from birch-pollen and apple hypersensitivity, and on a control group of 10 patients. The frequency of positive prick test results in the allergic patient group ranged from 73% for the major allergen from Golden Delicious apples to 97% with Bet v I and whole birch pollen extract, respectively. In contrast to our low-temperature extracts, commercial prick test solutions of four different manufacturers were found to be unreliable for the diagnosis of apple allergy. The skin test results again indicated the strong immunologic activity of the allergen isolates and the predominance of the major allergens in context with birch-pollen and apple hypersensitivity.

The lubricants were based on mineral hydrocarbon fractions. The cans were of aluminium two-piece construction (two sizes) and tin-plate steel three-piece construction (two sizes) and of four representative types. Gas chromatographic analysis was used to distinguish the two press lubricants from one another by their n-alkane profiles. Analysis of solvent extracts of the cans indicated that one of the two press lubricants had been used in the manufacture of the three-piece cans and the other lubricant for the two-piece cans. Residual levels of hydrocarbons were between 0.05 and 1.1 mg per can. Based on the capacity of the cans and assuming all the mineral hydrocarbon transferred to the contents, maximum levels in foods and beverages could be between 0.1 and 4.4 mg/kg.

A series of oligomers which appear to be characteristic of RGase degradation could be recognized. These oligomers were isolated on a preparative scale by size-exclusion chromatography and preparative anion-exchange chromatography and analyzed for sugar composition. 1H NMR spectroscopy showed that the oligomers consisted of between 4 and 9 sugar units with a backbone of alternating rhamnose and galacturonic acid residues, partly substituted with galactose residues linked to C-4 of the rhamnose moiety. The HPLC elution pattern showed that higher oligomers were also formed during incubation with RGase. These have the same basic structure but may contain other sugar units in addition to those given above. The oligomer composition of RGase digests of MHR isolated from apple, pear, leek, onion, carrot, and potato was very similar. Using anion-exchange chromatography to monitor the degradation of MHR at increasing incubation times, it was found that all the oligomers were present from the initial stages of the enzyme reaction and that the ratio between the different oligomers remained constant with time.

The thermodynamics of CD.CA inclusion complex formation, which were studied in solution using UV spectrophotometry, displayed enthalpy-entropy compensation typical of processes driven by solvation phenomena. We also found that the apparent association constants (K) of the CD.CA equilibrium were relatively insensitive to pH for beta-CD, compared to alpha- and gamma-CDs, but were subject to substantial enhancement at low ionic strengths. The beta-CD.CA inclusion complex was also characterized for binding geometry and stoichiometry at 9.4 T and 25 degrees C in 0.05 M Na phosphate buffer by 1H NMR spectroscopy. A 1:1 stoichiometric ratio for the complex was found using the method of continuous variations. 1H Spin-lattice relaxation and chemical-shift data indicate that the phenolic ring of CA docks within the cavity of beta-CD. The Ks for beta-, alpha-, and gamma-CD determined in apple juice, which contains a mixture of PPO substrates, were found to correlate with PPO activity-related data. Apple juice, treated with beta-CDn, did not brown until CA was added back.

8338842,"The enzyme that oxidatively converts 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (ACC) to ethylene, a key plant growth hormone, has been classified, on the basis of a comparison of homologous protein sequences (derived from the cDNA sequences), as a member of a family of non-heme iron proteins that includes plant and bacterial oxidative enzymes. This knowledge has facilitated the purification of the relatively abundant ethylene-forming enzyme to homogeneity from apple tissue. The properties of the enzyme are consistent with two other recent reports that describes its purification by different protocols, lending credence to the assertion that the key protein has been isolated. New characterizations of the protein have been conducted. Electrospray mass spectrometry shows that its molecular weight (35 331.8 +/- 5 amu) is approximately 50 amu higher than that predicted from the cDNA sequence, identifying the blocking group at the N-terminus as acetyl. The enzyme is activated by bicarbonate at low concentration but is inhibited at high concentration, with the maximum activation occurring at 5 mM. The iron concentration leading to half-maximal activity is 1 microM. The enzyme self-inactivates during turnover.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the value of end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) in screening for sleep apneas. Thirty-nine patients referred to our sleep laboratory because of suspected SAS and ten normal subjects were studied. The EtCO2 was measured using an infrared spectrometer (POET) designed for simultaneous measurement of CO2 and pulse oximetry. In 29 subjects, expired gas was sampled with a nasobuccal mask (Respiron) with lateral orifices. In the other 20 subjects, sampling was done with nasobuccal prongs (Criticare) comprising a four-channel plastic tube to the mouth and the nostrils. Data from an 8-h night were transferred the following day to a microcomputer (Apple Macintosh) for processing. Apnea was defined as an absence of detection of CO2 for more than 10 s. Conventional polysomnography was performed (Respisomnographe). The number of apneas in 8 h and the apnea index (number of apneas in 1 h) were calculated after visual analysis on the screen of the polysomnograph and also with EtCO2 analysis. For recordings made with a nasobuccal mask, the regression curve between the apnea indices computed with EtCO2 and polysomnography was an order 2 polynomial curve (r = 0.76; p < 0.001), with an inflection point at 39 apneas per hour. For recordings with nasobuccal prongs, the correlation was very significant (r = 0.95; p < 0.0001), and the regression curve was linear.

1764467,"A fluorescent bile salt, cholyl-lysylfluorescein (cholyl-lys-F), was synthesised so that it retained both an intact steroid ring and a side chain structure with an unblocked carboxyl group. Its biliary kinetics and hepatic extraction were studied in Wistar rats and in the isolated perfused rat liver, respectively. The synthetic method used excess N-epsilon-CBZ-l-lysine methyl ester hydrochloride (7 mmol) and cholic acid (5 mmol) via EEDQ with a yield of 94% for cholyl-lys. Cholyl-lys-F was synthesized employing equimolar amounts of cholyl-lys (sodium salt) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) in bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.5) over 16 h at room temperature (21 degrees C) with a yield of 70%. The fluorescent property of cholyl-lys-F was similar to fluorescein with a strong apple-green fluorescence. In bile-fistula rats under pentobarbital anaesthesia, the cumulative 20 min biliary excretion as a percentage of injected dose were as follows: cholyl-lys-F, 94.4 +/- 0.3%, [14C]cholylglycine (CG), 93.1 +/- 1.2% and fluorescein (F), 34.8 +/- 0.5. Furthermore the single-pass hepatic extraction of cholyl-lys-F was 64.1 +/- 3.9%, [14C]CG was 66.1 +/- 1.2% and F was 16.5 +/- 2%. The similarity in biliary output and hepatic extraction of cholyl-lys-F to that of the natural bile acid cholylglycine suggest that both compounds are handled in a similar fashion.

24186277,"1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase (EC 4.4.1.14) purified from apple (Malus sylvestris Mill.) fruit was subjected to trypsin digestion. Following separation by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, ten tryptic peptides were sequenced. Based on the sequences of three tryptic peptides, three sets of mixed oligonucleotide probes were synthesized and used to screen a plasmid cDNA library prepared from poly(A)(+) RNA of ripe apple fruit. A 1.5-kb (kilobase) cDNA clone which hybridized to all three probes were isolated. The clone contained an open reading frame of 1214 base pairs (bp) encoding a sequence of 404 amino acids. While the polyadenine tail at the 3'-end was intact, it lacked a portion of sequence at the 5'-end. Using the RNA-based polymerase chain reaction, an additional sequence of 148 bp was obtained at the 5'-end. Thus, 1362 bp were sequenced and they encode 454 amino acids. The deduced amino-acid sequence contained peptide sequences corresponding to all ten tryptic fragments, confirming the identity of the cDNA clone. Comparison of the deduced amino-acid sequence between ACC synthase from apple fruit and those from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and winter squash (Cucurbita maxima Duch.) fruits demonstrated the presence of seven highly conserved regions, including the previously identified region for the active site. The size of the translation product of ACC-synthase mRNA was similar to that of the mature protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), indicating that apple ACC-synthase undergoes only minor, if any, post-translational proteolytic processing. Analysis of ACC-synthase mRNA by in-vitro translation-immunoprecipitation, and by Northern blotting indicates that the ACC-synthase mRNA was undetectable in unripe fruit, but was accumulated massively during the ripening proccess. These data demonstrate that the expression of the ACC-synthase gene is developmentally regulated.

2125970,"A pilot study using female cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) and female rhesus (Macaca mulatta) monkeys was conducted to study the effects of chronic ingestion of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Four control and four treated monkeys of each species received an apple juice-gelatin mixture containing 0 and 280 micrograms Aroclor 1254/kg body weight/day, respectively, 5 days/wk. The cynomolgus monkeys, which were mature monkeys with a poor breeding history, were treated for approximately 55 wk, while the rhesus monkeys, which were just attaining sexual maturity, were treated for approximately 120 wk. After 38 wk on test, the treated and control rhesus monkeys were mated with untreated males. The clinical signs resulting from the Aroclor 1254 ingestion were similar for both species, and the time of onset after initiation of treatment was not appreciably different between the two species. Several treatment and interspecies differences were found with regard to the haematological and serum biochemistry parameters monitored, but age differences between the two species may have contributed to these findings. Periodic analysis of adipose tissue, blood and faecal specimens for PCBs suggested that the rhesus monkey retained more of the ingested PCB than did the cynomolgus monkey.

2226435,"The finding of a powerful inhibitor of pectin methylesterase in ripe kiwi fruit is reported. The inhibitor was revealed to be a glycoprotein. It was purified to homogeneity and found to have a molecular mass of about 28 kDa, as estimated by gel filtration chromatography, SDS/PAGE and analytical ultracentrifugation. The sugar portion is composed of galactose, arabinose and rhamnose, the latter being much less represented. The amino acid composition showed a very high content of acidic residues compared to basic ones, which is the reason for the very low isoelectric point of the protein (less than 3.5). The kind of inhibition on kiwi pectin methylesterase was found to be competitive with an apparent Ki of 0.22 microM, using citrus pectin as a substrate. Moreover, the inhibitor is effective in inhibiting pectin methylesterase in the pH range 3.5-7.5. Kiwi inhibitor appears to be specific for pectin methylesterase, inasmuch as it was found to be ineffective against other polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, such as polygalacturonase and amylase.

Apple ACC synthase was purified with an immunoaffinity gel, and its active site was probed with NaB3H4 or Ado[14C]Met. HPLC separation of the trypsin digest yielded a single radioactive peptide. Peptide sequencing of both 3H- and 14C-labeled peptides revealed a common dodecapeptide of Ser-Leu-Ser-Xaa-Asp-Leu-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gly-Phe-Arg, where Xaa was the modified, radioactive residue in each case. Acid hydrolysis of the 3H-labeled enzyme released radioactive N-pyridoxyllysine, indicating that the active-site peptide contained lysine at position 4. Mass spectrometry of the 14C-labeled peptide indicated a protonated molecular ion at m/z 1390.6, from which the mass of Xaa was calculated to be 229, a number that is equivalent to the mass of a lysine residue alkylated by the 2-aminobutyrate portion of AdoMet, as we previously proposed. These results indicate that the same active-site lysine binds the PLP and convalently links to the 2-aminobutyrate portion of AdoMet during inactivation. The active site of tomato ACC synthase was probed in the same manner with Ado[14C]Met.

16667601,"Previous (18)O labeling studies of abscisic acid (ABA) have shown that apple (Malus domestica Borkh. cv Granny Smith) fruits synthesize a majority of [(18)O]ABA with the label incorporated in the 1'-hydroxyl position and unlabeled in the carboxyl group (JAD Zeevaart, TG Heath, DA Gage [1989] Plant Physiol 91: 1594-1601). It was proposed that exchange of (18)O in the side chain with the medium occurred at an aldehyde intermediate stage of ABA biosynthesis. We have isolated ABA-aldehyde and 1'-4'-trans-ABA-diol (ABA-trans-diol) from (18)O-labeled apple fruit tissue and measured the extent and position of (18)O incorporation by tandem mass spectrometry. (18)O-Labeling patterns of ABA-aldehyde, ABA-trans-diol, and ABA indicate that ABA-aldehyde is a precursor to, and ABA-trans-diol a catabolite of, ABA. Exchange of (18)O in the carbonyl of ABA-aldehyde can be the cause of loss of (18)O from the side chain of [(18)O]ABA. Results of feeding experiments with deuterated substrates provide further support for the precursor-product relationship of ABA-aldehyde --> ABA --> ABA-trans-diol. The ABA-aldehyde and ABA-trans-diol contents of fruits and leaves were low, approximately 1 and 0.02 nanograms per gram fresh weight for ABA-aldehyde and ABA-trans-diol, respectively, while ABA levels in fruits ranged from 10 to 200 nanograms per gram fresh weight. ABA biosynthesis was about 10-fold lower in fruits than in leaves. In fruits, the majority of ABA was conjugated to beta-d-glucopyranosyl abscisate, whereas in leaves ABA was mainly hydroxylated to phaseic acid.

The enzyme was isolated from a residual powder obtained from ripe apples homogenized with cold acetone. The extract thus prepared was used to characterize the enzyme, and it showed an optimum pH of 5.36 and an optimum temperature of 35 degrees C. The substrate specificity proved to decrease from 4-methyl catechol, chlorogenic acid, catechol, and caffeic acid, to 3,4-dihydroxiphenyl alanine (DOPA). The enzyme resulted to be more thermostable (temperature range: 35 degrees C to 60 degrees C) than the rest of oxidases of plant origin. When the extract was eluted under conditions of hydrophobic chromatography separation, it appeared as a single peak resulting in a 300 fold purification. The phenolase activity characteristics found in the present study were similar to those observed in other apples from temperate climates; however, this particular polyphenoloxidase is more thermostable under natural conditions. This explains why apples of the Anna variety, at the high harvesting temperature, show a very fast formation of brown spots even when there is a minor damage.

Excellent agreement, with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.99, was observed in fresh potato samples homogenized with sulfite and allowed to react for different time intervals (enzymatic browning system). A good overall correlation was observed in dehydrated, sulfited apple samples heated for different times (nonenzymatic browning system); however, as heating time increased, higher results were obtained by the Monier-Williams method than by the alkali extraction/ion exclusion chromatographic method. The results of determining sulfite in the alkali trapping solution following acid distillation or acid treatment without heat suggested that this deviation was due to a fraction of sulfite bound to the browning reaction products in such a way that it was released by acid distillation but not by alkali extraction or acid treatment without heat. Similar behavior was demonstrated in cabbage with naturally occurring sulfite, which was released by acid distillation but not by alkali extraction or acid treatment without heat.

M.26 and M.9 were cultured in vitro using Linsmaier-Skoog medium supplemented with benzyladenine (BA), indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), and 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid (PG). Rooting response was tested in Lepoivre medium supplemented with IBA and PG. IBA concentrations of 12.0 and 4.0 micromolar induced the maximum rooting percentages for M.9 and M.26, respectively. At these concentrations rooting response was 100% for M.26 and 80% for M.9. Free and conjugated IAA levels were determined in M.26 and M.9 shoots prior to root inducing treatment by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection and validated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using (13)[C(6)]IAA as internal standard. Basal sections of M.26 shoots contained 2.8 times more free IAA than similar tissue in M.9 (477.1 +/- 6.5 versus 166.6 +/- 6.7 nanograms per gram fresh weight), while free IAA levels in apical sections of M.26 and M.9 shoots were comparable (298.0 +/- 4.4 versus 263.7 +/- 9.3 nanograms per gram fresh weight). Conjugated IAA levels were significantly higher in M.9 than in M.26 indicating that a greater proportion of total IAA was present as a conjugate in M.9.

The reactivity of MAB was, with a few exceptions, limited to type II GBS. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that an antigen purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using MAB from type II GBS contained galactose, glucose and fatty acids. This confirmed that MAB is directed to the digalactose (which in earlier studies was found to occur) in the capsular lipocarbohydrate specific to type II GBS. The positive strains yielded a strong, apple-green surface stain by means of the IF using MAB. Various immuno-electron microscopic (IEM) methods showed that the determinant was located in the glycocalyx layer of GBS at a distance of about 15 nm from the streptococcal cell wall. The structure harbouring the determinant was found to be very loosely attached to the bacteria. However the cross-reactive determinant seemed to maintain its immunoreactivity whether it was extracted by gentle washing with saline or with harsher treatments usually reserved for preparing streptococcal polysaccharide antigens. In conclusion, the study shows that the determinant is an integral part of the type-specific antigen of type II GBS and that MAB has a potential use as a serotyping reagent.","APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica","['D000911', 'D000942', 'D001441', 'D015153', 'D003429', 'D000939', 'D005455', 'D008401', 'D006023', 'D008070', 'D008855', 'D011134', 'D012703', 'D013292']","['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Bacterial', 'Bacteroides fragilis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cross Reactions', 'Epitopes', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Glycoproteins', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Polysaccharides', 'Serotyping', 'Streptococcus agalactiae']",Bacteroides fragilis lipopolysaccharide and group B streptococcus serotype II glycocalyx have a common major antigenic determinant.,"['Q000276', 'Q000276', 'Q000276', None, None, None, None, None, 'Q000276', 'Q000276', None, 'Q000276', None, 'Q000276']","['immunology', 'immunology', 'immunology', None, None, None, None, None, 'immunology', 'immunology', None, 'immunology', None, 'immunology']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2458746,1988,0,0,apple-green color,apple,0.08333333333333333,"['lipopolysaccharide', 'glucose', 'galactose', 'fatty acids', 'Bacteroides fragilis']",1,5

3130804,"Cutinase, an extracellular enzyme, was induced by cutin in a fluorescent Pseudomonas putida strain that was found to be cohabiting with an apparently nitrogen-fixing Corynebacterium. This enzyme was purified from the culture fluid by acetone precipitation followed by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, QAE-Sephadex, Sepharose 6B, and Sephadex G-100. The purified enzyme showed a single band when subjected to polyacrylamide electrophoresis and the enzymatic activity coincided with the protein band. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis showed a single band at a molecular weight of 30,000 and gel filtration of the native enzyme through a calibrated Sephadex G-100 column indicated a molecular weight of 30,000, showing that the enzyme is a monomer. The amino acid composition of bacterial cutinase is distinctly different from that of fungal or plant cutinases. This bacterial cutinase showed a broad pH optimum between 8.5 and 10.5 with 3H-labeled apple cutin as the substrate. Linear rates of cutin hydrolysis were measured up to 20 min of incubation time and 4 mg/ml of cutin gave the maximum hydrolysis rate. This cutinase catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl esters of C4 to C16 fatty acids with decreasing V and increasing Km for the longer chain esters. It did not hydrolyze tripalmitoyl glycerol or trioleyl glycerol, indicating that this is not a general lipase. Active serine-directed reagents such as organophosphates and organoboronic acids severely inhibited the enzyme, suggesting that bacterial cutinase is an ""active serine"" enzyme. Neither thiol-directed reagents nor metal ion chelators had any effect on this enzyme. Antibody raised against purified enzyme gave a single precipitin line on Ouchterlony double diffusion analysis.

Details of sample type, concentrations of standards, dilutions and replication are entered from the keyboard. The calibration graph is constructed using a moving quadratic fit routine and the concentrations of the analyte in unknown solutions calculated.

Leaf samples (100 discs of 2.2 cm diameter) were collected from treated and control trees before treatment and at 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, 90 and 112 days after treatment. Fruit samples were taken at mid-season (56 days) and at harvest (112 days). The objective of this study was to determine the captan residue and mutagenicity of leaf and fruit extracts to ascertain the potential health hazard to agricultural workers in these orchards. Surface residues were extracted from leaves and fruits with methylene chloride. These extracts were subsequently analyzed for captan by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) utilizing an electron-capture detector, and for mutagenicity with two strains (TA98 and TA100) of Salmonella typhimurium, with and without microsomal enzyme activation. Positive mutagenic effects were observed with strain TA100 at 0-14 days post spray, even with extracts from one leaf disc's surface (3.8 cm2) of the single treatment. Captan residues in these samples indicated a decline from 9.3 micrograms/cm2 at 0 days to 0.80 micrograms/cm2 at 14 days and a trace after 112 days. With the standard treatment, in which captan was incorporated eight times in the program starting at the 7-day interval, leaf extracts showed mutagenic activity at 7, 14, 28 and 90 days. Captan residues at these intervals were 11.4, 5.0, 4.1 and 3.4 micrograms/cm2, respectively. Fruit sample extracts of the standard spray were mutagenic to the tester strains TA100 and TA98 both at mid-season and at harvest. Residues of captan on fruits declined from 10.4 micrograms/cm2 at mid-season to 1.1 micrograms/cm2 at harvest. No mutagenic activity was detected with extracts from fruit samples from the single captan application.","Journal of environmental science and health. Part.

The pyrolyzates are potent mutagenic and carcinogenic heterocyclic amines formed during cooking. Solution of these amines was mixed with aqueous suspension of bacterial cells or dietary fibers, and removal of these amines from the reaction mixture by centrifugation was defined as the binding. Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 were effectively bound to all gram-positive and some gram-negative bacterial cells, corn bran, apple pulp, and soy bean fiber. Binding of Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and cellulose was moderate, and to chitin and chitosan it was little. None but corn bran bound Glu-P-1 and Glu-P-2 effectively. Corn bran effectively bound all mutagens tested. The quantity of the binding of IQ, MeIQ, and MeIQx was dependent on the strain of bacteria and the kind of fiber. The mechanism of binding of Trp-P-2 to freeze-dried feces, Lactobacillus casei YIT 9018 (LC9018), and corn bran was investigated. The binding was pH dependent, occurred instantaneously, and was inhibited by the addition of metal salts.

3728982,"A rapid and sensitive method for the determination of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) in apple tissues is described. This method is based on the derivatization of ACC with phenylisothiocyanate, and the subsequent separation and quantification of the resulting phenylthiocarbamyl-ACC by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Phenylthiocarbamylation of ACC (and other amino acids) in apple extracts is complete within 20 min at room temperature. After removing solvents and reagent, the phenylthiocarbamyl derivatives are separated on an octadecyl reverse-phase column, eluted with a mixture of acetonitrile and sodium acetate buffer at pH 4.6, and monitored with a uv detector set at 254 nm. An analysis of apple extract can thus be achieved in 23 min and detect quantities as low as 1 pmol. Assays have been done to compare the efficiency of this method with that of a method using an ion-exchange amino acid analyzer and with that of Lizada and Yang's method [(1979), Anal.

Conjugates of ABA, were quantified after alkaline hydrolysis. The validity of the radioimmunoassay was tested by comparison of immunoassay estimates of ABA at different levels of extract purity with high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antiserum, raised against (+)-ABA, was almost equally sensitive to (-)-ABA. Serum cross-reactivity with the methyl ester of ABA was 160% and with the glycosyl ester of ABA was 34%. Cross-reactivity with protein-ABA conjugates was very slight for C'4-conjugated keyholelimpet haemocyanin, but about 1000% for C1-conjugated alkaline phosphatase. Other compounds tested showed extremely low or undetectable cross-reactivities. Further evidence for the specificity of the assay came from the agreement between the results using different assay methods for both apple and pepper extracts, and from the observation that the only zone of immunoreactivity on HPLC elution profiles corresponded with authentic (+)-ABA. The use of polyvinylpyrrolidone in the assay minimised interference by other substances in plant extracts. In pepper, free ABA levels increased rapidly during water stress and recovered to pre-stress levels within two days after rewatering. Levels of ABA conjugates were significantly lowr than free ABA in unstressed plants, and also increased rapidly with stress, although not to the same extent as free ABA, and did not recover as rapidly as did free ABA. In apple, levels of free ABA and of ABA conjugates both increased more than twofold over a two-week period of water stress. In contrast to pepper, however, immunoreactivity of the conjugate fraction was increased by hydrolysis, indicating that different ABA conjugates predominate in the two species.

7127808,"The relationship between direct-potentiometric and flame-photometric measurements of sodium has been studied in human sera and other, simpler systems. When water content was varied by using an inert substance (silica), de-ionized sera, or de-ionized individual proteins, the percentage that the flame photometric values were of the direct potentiometric Na+ values was identical to the measured water content. However, in 35 patients the percentage of Na+ values was 99.1% and the water content was 92.0%, a discrepancy of 7.1%. De-ionization of sera removed this discrepancy, apparently because of the lower pH of the de-ionized sera. The percentage of flame-photometric to direct-potentiometric Na+ values varied as a function of pH in pooled sera; in lyophilized and reconstituted sera; and in de-ionized, lyophilized, and reconstituted sera. Four explanations for the discrepancy between the percentage of Na+ values and the water content are discussed: a calibration problem, a measurement artifact, Na+ binding, and water binding. At this time there are no definitive data concerning which explanation is correct.

7082284,"1. Methylation analysis of potato (Solanum tuberosum) lectin and thorn-apple (Datura stramonium) lectin confirmed previous conclusions that both glycoproteins contained high proportions of l-arabinofuranosides and lesser amounts of d-galactopyranosides. The arabinofuranosides are present in both lectins as short unbranched chains containing 1-->2- and 1-->3-linkages, which are known to be linked to hydroxyproline. Galactopyranosides are present as monosaccharides, which are known to be attached to serine, in potato lectin and as both the monosaccharide and the 1-->3-linked disaccharide in Datura lectin. 2. Alkaline digestion of potato lectin and subsequent separation of the components by gel filtration led to the isolation of four fractions corresponding to the mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-arabinosides of hydroxyproline. The latter two fractions accounted for over 70% of the total hydroxyproline. 3. Methylation analysis was used to show that the triarabinoside contained only 1-->2-linkages between sugars, but that the tetra-arabinoside contained both 1-->2- and 1-->3-linkages. Direct-insertion mass spectrometry of these compounds using electron impact and chemical ionization, in a comparison with other known structural patterns, was used to determine the sequences of the sugars, which were Araf1-->2Araf1-->2Araf1-->Hyp and Araf1-->3Araf1-->2Araf1-->2Araf 1-->Hyp. 4. On the basis of optical rotation it had previously been suggested [Allen, Desai, Neuberger & Creeth (1978) Biochem. J.171, 665-674] that all the arabinose of potato lectin was present as the beta-l-furanoside. However, measurement of the optical rotations of the hydroxyprolyl arabinosides showed that whereas the diarabinoside had a molar rotation ([m]) value close to that predicted, the triarabinoside was more dextrorotatory and the tetra-arabinoside was less dextrorotatory than expected. Possible explanations for these findings are that, although the di- and tri-arabinosides contain exclusively beta-arabinofuranosides, in the tri-arabinoside, interactions between pentose units lead to an enhanced positive rotation. The tetra-arabinoside, however, is proposed to contain a single alpha-arabinofuranoside residue, which is responsible for the lower than expected positive rotation. The observed rotation of the tetra-arabinoside was found to be close to the theoretical value predicted on that basis. Furthermore, the action of a specific alpha-arabinofuranosidase on the tetrasaccharide was to remove a single arabinose residue, presumably the terminal non-reducing sugar, and to produce a product that was indistinguishable on electrophoresis from the triarabinoside. Changes in rotation were compatible with this assumption. 5. It is concluded that the structures of the hydroxyprolyl tri- and tetra-arabinosides of potato lectin are: betaAraf1-->2betaAraf1-->2betaAraf1-->Hyp and alphaAraf1-->3betaAraf1-->2betaAraf 1-->2betaAraf1-->Hyp.

7325959,"The lectin from Datura stramonium (thorn-apple; Solanaceae) has been purified by affinity chromatography and shown to be a glycoprotein containing about 40% (w/w) of carbohydrate. The most abundant amino acids are hydroxyproline, cystine, glycine and serine. Results obtained by gel filtration in 6m-guanidinium chloride on Sepharose 4B suggest that it has a subunit mol.wt. of about 30000 and that it probably associates into dimers. The lectin is inhibited specifically by chitin oligosaccharides and bacterial-cell-wall oligosaccharides, but only weakly by N-acetylglucosamine. Glycopeptides from soya-bean (Glycine max) lectin and fetuin are also strong inhibitors of Datura lectin, indicating that it interacts with internal N-acetylglucosamine residues. Its specificity is similar to, but not identical with, that of potato (Solanum tuberosum) lectin. After prolonged proteolytic digestion of reduced and S-carboxymethylated or S-aminoethylated derivatives of the lectin, glycopeptides of mol.wt. of about 18000 were isolated. The glycopeptides contained all the carbohydrate and hydroxyproline of the original glycoprotein, and lesser amounts of serine, S-carboxymethylcysteine and other amino acids. The arabinose residues of the glycoprotein are present as beta-l-arabinofuranosides linked to the polypeptide chain through the hydroxyproline residues, and can be removed by mild acid treatment; the ratio of arabinose to hydroxyproline is 3.4:1. Some of the serine residues of the polypeptide chain are substituted with one or two alpha-galactopyranoside residues, most of which can be removed by the action of alpha-galactosidase. The galactose residues are more easily removed from the acid-treated glycopeptide (from which arabinose has been removed) than from the complete glycopeptide, indicating a steric hindrance of the galactosidase action by the adjacent chains of arabinosides.

The strains are representative members of the three main genetic races of Agrobacterium. The purity of the final preparations was established by electrophoresis with an without sodium dodecyl sulphate, by analytical isoelectric focusing and ultracentrifugation, and by N-terminal analysis. 2. Properties of these cytochromes were compared wih those of cytochrome c-556 from A. tumefaciens, strain B2a, a member of the same genetic race as strain B6. The four cytochromes are monohaem proteins with molecular weights of about 12300 (determined by four different methods). The isoelectric points of those from strains B6 and B2a are identical at pH 5.5, but they differ from the cytochromes of the other genetic races: cytochrome c-556 from strain Apple 185 is more acidic (ph 5.2) and that from strain II Chrys more basic (pH 6.2). The cytochromes from strains b6 and B2a have very similar but not identical amino acid compositions; both of them differ more from Apple 185 than from II Chrys c-556. 3.

958361,"Various authors have defined organoleptically the concept ""cooking flavour"" for heat-treated apple juice and concentrate. In a similar way, the ""irradiation flavour"" caused by gamma radiation is defined in the present paper. It has been found that the irradiation flavour is attributable to low-boiling substances which appear already in the first fraction if the modified MICKO distillation is performed. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) has been identified as the key substance in irradiation flavour. As further evidence may be quoted the similarity of the intensity of off-flavour which was observed also by gas chromatography at the same times of retention, and the removal of the irradiation flavour by means of a THF-specific agent (mercury acetate). In connection with THF solutions added to non-irradiated apple juice, the authors employed the technique of ""subjective olfactometry"", using the ""absolute value scale"", to establish mathematical correlations between the intensity of irradiation flavour and the concentration of off-flavour products in apple juice or concentrate. The dependence of the intensity of irradiation flavour on the THF concentration and the gamma radiation dose, respectively, obeyed an exponential function. Thus, it has been possible to calculate the amounts of THF formed by radiation doses varying from 0.64 to 2.55 Mrad. Furthermore, the authors determined the minimum radiation dose for 12% apple juice and for 67% apple concentrate at which the irradiation flavour is first perceived (treshold of perception).",Die Nahrung,"['D003037', 'D004307', 'D005514', 'D005638', 'D005663', 'D009812', 'D011830', 'D013649']","['Cobalt Radioisotopes', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Food Irradiation', 'Fruit', 'Furans', 'Odorants', 'Radiation Effects', 'Taste']",[New methods for evaluation and analysis of organoleptic qualities of foods and for calculation of changes. 9.

Their reduction products were isolated from a phenolic fraction released from the cutin of the fruits of apple, peach, pear, and two varieties of tomato and apple leaf by treatment with LiAlH(4) or LiAlD(4). They were identified by combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. p-Coumaric acid was present in all samples of cutin (0.07-0.53% by weight), whereas only peach and pear cutin contained measurable amounts of ferulic acid (0.007% and 0.035%, respectively).

A significant part (48%) of the p-coumaric acid contained in tomato cutin was contained in the insoluble material recovered after partial degradation (7.4%) of this cutin with 0.01 m NaOH. These data indicate that these phenolic components are tightly (possibly covalently) bound to cutin. Similar analysis of the phenolic fractions from the suberins of potato, sweet potato, turnip, rutabaga, carrot, and red beet revealed that they contained only ferulic acid (0.05-0.22%).

The results also suggest that patulin may be important in the decay of apples by P. expansum.",Applied microbiology,"['D002855', 'D005506', 'D005516', 'D005638', 'D009183', 'D010407']","['Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Food Contamination', 'Food Microbiology', 'Fruit', 'Mycotoxins', 'Penicillium']",Patulin production in apples decayed by Penicillium expansum.,"[None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000302']","[None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'isolation & purification']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4726831,1973,0,0,PAT production,apple,0.23809523809523808,"['mycotoxin', 'patulin']",1,5
6030281,"1. The polysaccharide compositions of the cell walls of sycamore cambium and sycamore callus tissue have been analysed and found to be directly comparable. 2. Electrophoretic analyses of the whole pectins prepared from actively growing callus and cambial tissue have shown that these preparations contain, in addition to the neutral and weakly acidic components present in apple fruit, a strongly acidic polygalacturonic acid component. 3. The weakly acidic component of all the pectins was directly comparable with that of the pectinic acid of apple fruit. 4. The components of the whole pectin of sycamore callus tissue have been partially purified and analysed. The neutral and weakly acidic components also found in apple fruit were isolated. 5. The pattern of the composition of the neutral sugars present in the pectins of actively growing tissues of cambium and callus has been compared with those present in apple-fruit pectinic acid. 6. The presence of rhamnose linked as galacturonosyl-(1-->2)-rhamnose has been found in sycamore whole pectin. 7. The difference in the pectins of callus, cambium and fruit appears not to be that of species difference but is more characteristic of the nature of the growth and growth conditions of the cells. This is discussed in relation to the problems of the control and mechanism of plant-cell growth and differentiation.",The Biochemical journal,"['D001089', 'D002854', 'D004586', 'D005638', 'D005690', 'D005947', 'D066298', 'D008358', 'D010368', 'D010945', 'D012210', 'D014574', 'D014994']","['Arabinose', 'Chromatography, Paper', 'Electrophoresis', 'Fruit', 'Galactose', 'Glucose', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mannose', 'Pectins', 'Plants, Edible', 'Rhamnose', 'Uronic Acids', 'Xylose']",Pectic polysaccharides of growing plant tissues.,"['Q000032', None, None, None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', None, 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032', 'Q000032']","['analysis', None, None, None, 'analysis', 'analysis', None, 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis', 'analysis']",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6030281,1967,0,0,tree saccharides,apple,0.23214285714285715,"['sycamore cambium', 'cambium', 'pectins', 'polygalacturonic acid', 'sycamore whole pectin', 'rhamnose', 'sycamore', 'acid of apple fruit.', 'pectin']",1,13
16656273,"Phloridzin, the main phenolic glucoside in apple leaves, has been found to undergo transformation during chromatography. When chromatographed repeatedly in ammoniacal solvents, at least 2 new derivatives appeared. One of these was identified as phloretic acid. When bioassayed in the presence of indole-3-acetic acid this substance behaved as though it promoted the destruction of the auxin. Comparative bioassay with naphthaleneacetic acid suggested that phloretic acid acts on indoleacetic acid destruction via stimulation of indoleacetic acid oxidase. However, at low concentration and in presence of a small amount of phloridzin it also showed a synergistic effect with indoleacetic acid.A substance with the same characteristics was obtained directly from apple leaves, which are known to contain phloridzin when the extracts were chromatographed only once in the same (alkaline) solvent. While not completely confirmed, this suggests that phloretic acid is normally present in apple leaves, where it may affect growth there by promoting indoleacetic acid oxidation.",Plant physiology,[],[],Chromatographic degradation of phloridzin.,[],[],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16656273,2010,0,0,apple leaves,apple,0.2564102564102564,"['phenolic glucoside', 'indoleacetic acid', 'acid', 'phloridzin', 'naphthaleneacetic acid', 'indole-3-acetic acid']",1,10
14340052,"1. The pectic substances of apple have been extracted and separated into a pure pectinic acid and a neutral arabinan-galactan complex by precipitation of the acidic component with ethanol and with cetylpyridinium chloride. 2. The composition of the fractions has been determined. The pectinic acid contained galacturonic acid, arabinose, galactose, rhamnose, xylose and several trace sugars. 3. Transelimination degradation of the pectinic acid gave rise to two components completely separable by zone electrophoresis and by Sephadex gel filtration. Analysis of these components confirmed that the pectinic acid molecules contained long chains of esterified galacturonosyl residues, but showed in addition that more neutral portions containing a high proportion of arabinofuranose residues were attached to them. 4. The identification of rhamnose, galactose and xylose in aldobiouronic acids obtained from a partial hydrolysate of pectinic acid has shown that these sugars are covalently linked in the molecule, and it is suggested that the galacturonosyl-(1-->2)-rhamnose link is a general feature of pectinic acid structure. 5. The possible biological significance of pectinic acid structure has been discussed. 6. The arabinan-galactan complex contained nearly equal quantities of arabinose and galactose residues and some of its physical properties have been investigated.",The Biochemical journal,"['D001089', 'D001669', 'D001671', 'D002241', 'D002623', 'D002845', 'D002850', 'D004586', 'D004950', 'D005638', 'D005690', 'D006603', 'D027845', 'D010368', 'D011134', 'D012106', 'D014461']","['Arabinose', 'Biochemical Phenomena', 'Biochemistry', 'Carbohydrates', 'Chemistry Techniques, Analytical', 'Chromatography', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Electrophoresis', 'Esterases', 'Fruit', 'Galactose', 'Hexuronic Acids', 'Malus', 'Pectins', 'Polysaccharides', 'Research', 'Ultracentrifugation']",APPLE FRUIT PECTIC SUBSTANCES.,"[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]","[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14340052,1996,0,1,apple pectic substances,apple,0.41509433962264153,"['arabinose', 'xylose', 'Sephadex', 'acid', 'galactose', 'galacturonic acid', 'ethanol', 'rhamnose', 'esterified', 'sugars', 'acids', 'cetylpyridinium chloride']",1,22
